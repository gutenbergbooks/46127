<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear Boys</span>:</p>

<p>It hardly seems possible that I have written
as many as eleven volumes of this series, yet such
is the case. The present book is just one short
of a dozen, and if you are pleased with this,
perhaps I shall be encouraged to write the
twelfth book.</p>

<p>As for the present volume, I have endeavored
to give you in it a stirring account of what happened
to Jerry, Ned and Bob after they had
started out on an apparently simple errand to see
a certain man.</p>

<p>Ned Slade’s father was in business trouble, and
the lad and his friends volunteered to ask aid
from a Mr. Jackson. They started out to find
him, only to learn that he had gone to a balloon
carnival, as he was interested in air craft. The
boys went to the aviation meet, and arrived just
as Mr. Jackson went up in his big dirigible balloon.
Instead of coming back, as he was expected
to do, the millionaire sent a wireless message
stating that he and his friends were being
blown out to sea in a hurricane.</p>

<p>He asked for help, and our heroes, in their airship,
the <i>Comet</i>, started out over the ocean to the
rescue. How they accomplished it, the perils
they ran, the dangers from the escaping gas, and
how they brought Mr. Jackson and his unconscious
crew over a narrow plank, high above the
ocean, into their own craft, you will find told of
in this book.</p>

<p>I venture to hope that you will like this book
as well as you have those in the past, for that will
encourage me to write others for you.</p>

<p class="noic">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>“Well, Chunky, what do you think of the
idea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, Jerry. It seems as if it
might be a good one, but we’ve got a fine air-ship
now, and it would be a pity to spoil it.”</p>

<p>“Who said anything about spoiling it?” demanded
Jerry Hopkins, in rather indignant tones,
as he looked across the table at his chum, Bob
Baker, whose stoutness had gained him the nickname
of Chunky. “Who wants to spoil the
<i>Comet</i>, you old calamity howler?”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t you talking of ripping it apart
and putting some new-fangled attachment on it?
I say let well enough alone.”</p>

<p>“Say, if everybody was like you, Bob, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
wouldn’t be much done in this world. ‘Let well
enough alone!’ If Columbus had said that, America
would never have been discovered.”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll not. Here I come and propose a
good improvement for our air-ship, something
that will make it possible to do stunts over water,
and you sit down on it!”</p>

<p>“What, sit on the water?” asked Bob, with a
mischievous grin. “You know I never was much
good at floating, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out! Now be serious if it’s possible.
Honestly, what do you think of the idea?
Look at the illustration there. It shows a fellow
in an aeroplane getting his start on the water
instead of on land, and rising up in the air. The
article says that by means of the hydroplanes it
is possible for an aeroplane to also land on the
water and float. Now what I want to do is to
attach hydroplanes to our <i>Comet</i>. How
about it?”</p>

<p>“Gee! Anybody’d think you were delivering
a lecture on aeronautics, Jerry! But, as I said,
I don’t know what to say. You sprang this thing
on me so suddenly. I’d like a chance to think it
over.”</p>

<p>“Think it over! Why, it oughtn’t to take long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to decide on a feature like this. Our air-ship is
old-fashioned now. We’ve had it quite a while,
and you know there has been a big advance made
among the birdmen lately. Hydroplanes are the
latest idea, and I say we ought to put them on the
<i>Comet</i>, and also make other improvements. But
I can’t do it unless you and Ned agree, as we
each own a third interest in our air-ship.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I wonder where Ned is?” and
Bob looked out of the window, hoping he might
see the third member of the motor boys’ trio.
“Didn’t you meet him on your way over to my
house, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“No. I stopped for him, but his mother said
he was down at his father’s department store.
Say, I shouldn’t be surprised but what there was
some trouble in the Slade family, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the stout youth, his attention
temporarily taken off the subject of air-ships by
the serious tone in which his chum spoke. “What
makes you think that, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Because Mrs. Slade looked worried, and,
come to think of it, Ned hasn’t been around much
with us lately. He’s been down in the store a
number of nights, helping his father on the books,
he said. I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if there
was some trouble in the business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope not. But I wish Ned were here to
help settle this question.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take long to settle it when he does
come,” retorted Jerry, rising and going over to
the window, where he could get a better light on
a magazine he had brought so that he too might
show his chum some new ideas regarding air navigation.
“I know Ned will agree with me,” went
on the tall lad, “and you will be the obstructing
party.”</p>

<p>“Well, large bodies move slowly, you know,
Jerry. It takes me some time to make up my
mind. Just what do you want to do to the
<i>Comet</i>, anyhow? Put in a new steam-heating apparatus,
or add a gymnasium, and shower-baths,
and elevators?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t get funny, Bob! I’m serious.
What I want to do is to add the hydroplane feature.
That’s the biggest improvement, though
there are several smaller ones to be put in. But
it won’t be much work to attach the hydroplanes.
All we need to do is to build on some air-tight
floats, or boxes, which will do on the water exactly
what the bicycle wheels of an aeroplane do
on land&mdash;support it. Then, in case we have an
accident, say over the ocean, we can just drop
down, and float until we make repairs. Or, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that matter we can swim along on the water.”</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t expect to go over the ocean,
do you?”</p>

<p>“No, but you never can tell what you want to
do,” declared Jerry, “and the hydroplanes might
be very useful some day.”</p>

<p>The time was to come, and that not far distant,
when Jerry’s prediction was to bear fruit.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not in favor of ripping the good old
<i>Comet</i> too much apart,” declared Bob firmly.
“She carried us many a mile, and did good service.
Why, look at all we did in her. Look what
a help she was in rescuing those poor people from
the valley, when Professor Snodgrass got his
flying lizard.”</p>

<p>“That’s all true, but if we have a motor-ship
that can go on the water, the professor can get
a flying fish, or something like that, in case he goes
along with us on the next trip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll go all right enough,” spoke Bob,
with a laugh. “Dear old professor! We
wouldn’t know how to get along without him,
though he sometimes does the oddest things.”</p>

<p>“You’re getting away from the main discussion,”
said Jerry. “What about making the
changes?”</p>

<p>“I’m not exactly in favor of them!” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Bob, after a moment’s thought. “The <i>Comet</i>
was always good enough for us as she is, and why
change her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you and your ‘good enough’!” burst out
Jerry. “Why don’t you have some progressive
spirit in you?”</p>

<p>“I have, only I don’t want to spoil a good
thing and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hello! Here comes Ned, now!” interrupted
Jerry, looking out on the porch, the steps of which
a youth was at that moment ascending.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see what he says,” remarked Bob.
“I’ll wager that he’ll agree with me.”</p>

<p>“No, he’ll say that I’m right,” came from
Jerry. “I’ll let him in.”</p>

<p>Jerry was so eager to hear what the new-comer
would say, and Bob, because of his fleshy build,
was so slow in getting up that the tall lad was at
the front door before the young host had reached
the portal, and had admitted Ned Slade.</p>

<p>“Just in time, Ned!” greeted Jerry. “You
have the deciding vote.”</p>

<p>“What about?” asked Ned, and his chums
were at once aware of a change in his manner.
He spoke listlessly, and as if he was little interested.
He seemed tired out, too, as if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
been working too hard, and yet it was only the
beginning of the summer vacation.</p>

<p>“It’s about our motor-ship,” began Jerry.</p>

<p>“He wants to cut her all up, put on racing
skates, or water shoes, or something like that,
and add a lot of improvements,” broke in Bob,
with a grin at his tall chum.</p>

<p>“Hydroplanes! hydroplanes! not water shoes,
you old backwoodsman!” cried Jerry. “Here,
Ned, let me explain,” and with that the tall lad
launched into a lively description of the proposed
changes, with Bob interrupting every now and
then with an objection, or with some queer comment.</p>

<p>While the boys are thus engaged, I will take
a moment to tell you something about them, for,
though many of my readers are well acquainted
with the motor lads, some of my new friends may
never have been introduced to them.</p>

<p>The three chums were Jerry Hopkins, son of
a widow, Mrs. Julia Hopkins; Bob Baker, whose
father, Mr. Andrew Baker, was a wealthy banker;
and Ned Slade, son of Aaron Slade, proprietor of
a large department store.</p>

<p>The chums lived in Cresville, not far from Boston,
and they had gained the title “Motor Boys”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
from the fact that they had been associated with
motor vehicles for a long time.</p>

<p>Their early adventures on bicycles were told of
in the first volume of this series, entitled, “The
Motor Boys.” Later they got motor-cycles, and
soon after that an automobile. In this machine
they made a long trip overland, taking with them
a certain Professor Uriah Snodgrass, a learned
scientist, who was always searching for some
queer bug, reptile, or butterfly.</p>

<p>The boys went to Mexico, discovered a buried
city, and returned across the plains, and later they
purchased a motor-boat.</p>

<p>In this fine craft, named the <i>Dartaway</i>, they
had many adventures, not a few of which are set
down in the fifth volume of the series called “The
Motor Boys Afloat.” They made a long trip on
the Atlantic, and during the following vacation
had some surprising adventures in the Everglades
of Florida. Some time later they made a voyage
on the Pacific ocean in search of a mysterious
derelict. On this and on other trips they had
much trouble from a bully, Noddy Nixon, and his
crony, Bill Berry.</p>

<p>By this time the conquest of the air was well
under way, and it might have been expected that
our heroes would take part in it. They built an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
air-ship, with the aid of a Mr. Glassford, and
a wonderful craft it was. Christened the <i>Comet</i>,
their motor-ship was a combination of a dirigible
balloon and an aeroplane. That is, there
was a gas bag, which alone would support the machine
in air, and there were also side planes, which
were of service in case of accident to the gas bag.</p>

<p>In the book called “The Motor Boys in the
Clouds,” the air-ship is fully described, so I will
not take up space here to give the details of its
construction. Sufficient to say that it was capable
of long flights; it had a powerful motor and
other machinery, and there was a roomy cabin in
which the travellers of the air could live in comfort.
Large propellers enabled the <i>Comet</i> to
travel at a good speed.</p>

<p>Aboard her the boys had some exciting times,
and in the book named “The Motor Boys Over
the Rockies,” they were the means of rescuing
a party of white men and women who had long
been held in captivity by a band of Indians.</p>

<p>Returning from this trip, on which they were
accompanied by Professor Snodgrass, our friends
resumed their studies, and, now that winter was
over, and vacation at hand, they were planning
for new adventures.</p>

<p>As has just been told, Jerry Hopkins had called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
on his chum Bob to propose certain changes in
the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of my scheme?”
asked the widow’s son, as he finished explaining
to Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” was Ned’s rather listless
answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, for cats’ sake!” cried Jerry. “Don’t be
as Bob was! Say something, even if you don’t
agree with me. If both of you are down on the
idea, that settles it, and we’ll leave the <i>Comet</i> as
she is.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say!” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Let’s hear what Ned has to propose,” suggested
the tall lad. He looked at his other chum,
but Ned appeared strangely indifferent. He sat
looking out of the window, his thoughts apparently
elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Well, what about it, Ned?” asked Jerry, after
a pause.</p>

<p>“About what?” inquired Ned, with a start.</p>

<p>“Why, this air-ship!” exclaimed Jerry, in some
surprise. “Haven’t you been listening to what
I’ve said?”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I haven’t paid much attention,”
admitted Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Bob. “Are
you in trouble, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” and Ned spoke slowly.
“That is, <em>I’m</em> not, but dad&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I forgot.
I’m not supposed to tell,” and once more Ned
gazed gloomily out of the window.</p>

<p>“Look here, Ned,” spoke Jerry softly. “I
didn’t mean to inflict this talk on you when you’ve
got other things to think about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“And if there’s anything Bob or I can do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course,” broke in the fat lad. “Can’t we
help you, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. Dad doesn’t want it
talked about, though it’s bound to come out soon,
anyhow, I guess. If I tell you fellows it won’t
go any further, will it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” exclaimed Jerry and Bob together.</p>

<p>“I needn’t have asked that; I might have
known it wouldn’t,” said Ned. “Well, the truth
of it is that dad’s business is in bad shape.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that he is going to fail?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, it might amount to that, though we
hope to stave it off. I’ve been helping him on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
books lately, that’s what makes me so tired. I’ve
been up late for several nights. The business is
in fairly good shape, and can be made better if
we could do certain things.”</p>

<p>“What are they?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s too complicated to go much into detail
over,” explained Ned, “but, in brief, it’s this:
Certain opposition to dad’s department-store business
is being organized by a powerful syndicate.
Now, if dad could get the help and co-operation
of a certain man, everything would be all right.”</p>

<p>“Who is the man?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“His name is Mr. Wescott Jackson. He once
was in great trouble, and my father aided him.
Dad knows that if he could get into communication
with this man he would be only too glad to
help him, lend him his influence, and all that, and
then the business wouldn’t suffer.”</p>

<p>“Well, why doesn’t he ask aid of this Mr.
Jackson, then, Ned?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“He’d be only too glad to, but he can’t locate
him. And, another thing, dad’s enemies are interested
in keeping Mr. Jackson away from father.
That is, they don’t want dad to get word to him
of his trouble. So that complicates matters. If
I could only talk to Mr. Jackson, and get his signature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to certain documents, everything would
be all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, why can’t you?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where to look for Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p>“Say! we’ve done harder things than that!”
cried Jerry suddenly. “What’s the matter with
the three of us having a hunt for this Mr. Jackson?
Can’t we aid you, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I only wish you could.”</p>

<p>“We can!” declared the tall youth, with energy.
“Bob&mdash;Ned! We’ll let the air-ship go
for a while, and we’ll devote all our energies to
finding Mr. Jackson. What do you say, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I’m with you from the drop of the hat!”</p>

<p>“Good! Then, Ned, you can consider that
your father’s troubles, and yours, too, are in a
fair way to be settled when the Motor Boys get
on the trail,” and the tall lad clapped his chum
on the back with hearty good-will.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>NEWS OF MR. JACKSON</small></h2>


<p>“You feel better already, don’t you, Ned?”
asked Jerry a little later, following a brisk discussion
of the possible plans for locating Mr.
Jackson.</p>

<p>“I believe I do,” answered the son of the department-store
proprietor. “It’s always a relief
to be busy when you have trouble, for it takes
it off your mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll find that Mr. Jackson, too,”
declared Bob, with energy.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” added Ned. “But now, what
about this new hydroplane business, Jerry? I
can listen now with some attention since I’ve told
you what was on my mind.”</p>

<p>“Good! Then I hope you’ll agree with me,”
and Jerry proceeded to describe in detail what he
proposed doing.</p>

<p>Ned listened attentively, and asked several
questions, showing that he understood the plan
proposed by his chum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now then, Ned, are you with me or against
me?” demanded Jerry, at length.</p>

<p>“Against him!” put in Bob eagerly. “Don’t
let him spoil the <i>Comet</i>!”</p>

<p>“I’ll not spoil her,” cried Jerry. “Let Ned
speak for himself, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m for it!” exclaimed Ned, with sudden
energy. “It’s quite a radical change, but I
think it will be a good one. We may want to
make a trip over water, but until I can help out
my father I’m not going to do much else, so I
can’t be of any aid to you, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. We have all summer to
make the changes in, and Bob and I can be doing
part of it at odd times, while you’re working with
your father on the books. Of course, I mean
when we’re not looking for Mr. Jackson; eh,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m going to help?” demanded
the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re in the minority, and you always
said the majority ought to govern. We’re two
to your one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, go ahead!” exclaimed Bob, with
a gesture of despair. “Put a bath-room in the
<i>Comet</i> if you like, and I suppose I’ll have to stand
for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, you can lie down when you take a bath,”
observed Ned, with a grin, and his chums laughed,
taking it as a sign that the lad was forgetting
some of his worries.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go ahead when we get the chance,”
observed Jerry. “But now let’s go down to your
father’s store, Ned, and tell him we are on the
job.”</p>

<p>“And get some idea of where to hunt for this
mysterious Mr. Jackson,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;yes,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know that he’s so mysterious,” remarked
Ned. “It’s only that he is a very busy
man, and has so many interests&mdash;railroads, mines,
ships, building canals and trolley lines&mdash;so many
irons in the fire, that he may be in New York one
day, and off for London or San Francisco the next.
That’s why he’s so hard to get hold of.</p>

<p>“Then, too, he’s interested in some kind of
sport, I heard dad say. Yachting or motoring
or something like that, I can’t just remember, and
he’s likely to be off on a trip. Even his secretary
doesn’t know where to find him sometimes,
and when you stop to consider that the men who
are working against my father have some interests
in common with Mr. Jackson, and don’t
want him to know of my father’s trouble, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
can see that it’s going to be no easy proposition.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t a letter reach him?” inquired Bob,
as he got ready to accompany his chums out of the
house.</p>

<p>“We’ve tried letters and telegrams,” explained
Ned. “None of them are any good. I heard
dad say that sometimes letters follow Mr. Jackson
half way around the globe, and even then he
doesn’t get them. Oh, he’s a hard man to get in
touch with!”</p>

<p>“But we’ll do it!” declared Jerry, when they
were on their way to the department store.</p>

<p>Mr. Slade was both surprised and pleased when
his son, and the latter’s two chums, came into the
office, and Ned had explained the decision at which
they had arrived.</p>

<p>“Boys!” exclaimed the merchant, “I don’t know
how to thank you for your offer. I needn’t say
that it is going to be quite a task, for Ned has explained
what a peculiar man Mr. Jackson is, but I
like your spirit. I knew you and Ned were quite
chummy, and had been through lots of adventure
together, but I never imagined that you’d prove
a friend to the older folks in the family.</p>

<p>“It is certainly very good of you, and I appreciate
it more than I can tell. I’m afraid, though,
that it will break up your vacation plans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not at all,” Jerry assured Mr. Slade. “We
may get more fun out of hunting for Mr. Jackson
than you imagine. We’ll try for him in the auto,
and if that doesn’t catch him we’ll get after him
in the motor boat, and as a last resort&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The airship, with the new hydroplane feature!”
put in Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed Jerry. “But, Mr. Slade, if
we are to find this odd man, we ought to have
something to work on. Where was he located
last?”</p>

<p>“Out in San Francisco,” was the reply. “But
where he went from there no one seems to know.
He started East to inspect a new railroad he is
building, and from then on all trace of him has
been lost. I have agents in various parts of the
country trying to get a trace of him, but so far&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade was interrupted by the sudden ringing
of the telephone bell. He swung around to
his desk, in the private office where the talk was
taking place, and unhooked the receiver. The
boys listened to the one-sided conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” said Mr. Slade eagerly. “What’s
that? He is? Are you sure it’s the same man?
In Boston, you say&mdash;No, just outside&mdash;what’s
that? The name of the place is Durham? Yes,
I get it. Oh, say, I’m ever so much obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you, Burkhardt. Yes, I’ll get right after him.
In fact, I have some friends of mine here in the
office now who are anxious to start off on the
quest. Yes, they’re friends of Ned. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade turned to the three chums.</p>

<p>“Boys!” he cried, “I have a trace of Mr. Jackson.
He was in Boston yesterday, and is now
stopping at a health resort in Durham, resting up
after a hard business campaign.”</p>

<p>“In Durham!” cried Jerry. “That’s not far
from here. We could do it in one day in the
auto! We’re on his trail at last! Come on, fellows,
let’s get ready for the trip!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR’S QUEST</small></h2>


<p>The good news of the location of Mr. Jackson
was so unexpected, that, for a few moments
the little party in Mr. Slade’s office hardly knew
how to take it. Then they all began talking at
once, at least the boys did, until the merchant, with
a laugh, remarked that they were making so
much noise that the clerks would think something
serious had happened. This quieted the three
chums.</p>

<p>“Well, we’d better get started,” urged Jerry.
“Mr. Jackson may get away from Durham any
minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe he’s as bad as that,” ventured
Mr. Slade. “If he’s there for his health
he’ll be likely to remain for some time. I’d go see
him myself, but I dare not leave my business at
this critical juncture.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re only too glad to try and get into
touch with him for you,” asserted Bob. “How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
can we tell him if we meet him? Does Ned know
him?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Mr. Slade’s son. “I never
saw him, but dad has his picture.”</p>

<p>“Then we can take that along, and do a little
detective work,” suggested Jerry. “We’ll inquire
for a Mr. Jackson, and if he’s like the picture he’ll
be our man.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the photograph wouldn’t be of
great help,” said Mr. Slade. “It was taken a
number of years ago, and I fancy Mr. Jackson
has changed much in that time. However, I can
describe him to you, and give you a letter to him,
and that may answer. As I said, I ought really to
go myself, but if I left here, my enemies would
only make more trouble for me. Mr. Jackson is
the only man who can help me.”</p>

<p>There was more talk, and Mr. Slade gave his
son and the latter’s chums some directions as to
how to proceed. He also made out certain documents,
which, if Mr. Jackson would sign, would
end the department store troubles.</p>

<p>“Now to get our auto in shape!” exclaimed
Jerry as they prepared to leave the store. “I
hope we can get some speed out of the machine
without too much tinkering.”</p>

<p>“We’ll give it a try-out,” decided Bob. “Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a little run this afternoon, and see how she
works.”</p>

<p>The car the boys now owned was not the one
they had had originally. It was a more powerful
machine, though so interested had our friends
been in airship matters of late, that they had not
given their auto much use.</p>

<p>That afternoon saw the three chums speeding
down a quiet highway that led out of Cresville.
The auto ran well, but they discovered a few defects
and arranged to have them remedied at a
garage.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start for Durham the first thing
to-morrow, fellows!” cried Bob enthusiastically.
“Say, it’s fun to be doing something again. It’s
like old times!”</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed Jerry. “Can’t you put on
a little more speed, Ned?” For the merchant’s
son was at the wheel. “Cut out the muffler, and
use the accelerator pedal more. Make believe
we’re after Noddy Nixon, and that he’s getting
away from us. We may need speed if we have to
race after Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p>They were ascending a hill, and Ned had turned
on all the power he dared use, when, as he
swung around a bend, a small man suddenly
darted out right in front of the machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Jerry, leaning forward and
grasping the lap robe rail in front of him.</p>

<p>“Jam on the brakes! Toot your horn!” cried
Bob.</p>

<p>Ned did not answer. He had instinctively done
three things, blown the horn, jammed on the foot
and emergency hand brake, and had turned to one
side. He also gave a loud yell.</p>

<p>But the man who had so suddenly brought
about this commotion, paid not the least attention
to the trouble he had caused. With a small net
on the end of a long pole, extended in front of
him, he was chasing a brilliant little red butterfly,
which was flitting along, all unconscious of the
danger so close to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the net went down with a swoop, and
the butterfly was out of sight.</p>

<p>“I got him! I got him! I have the little
beauty! One of the rarest butterflies in this section
of the country! It’s worth fifty dollars if it’s
worth a cent! Oh, you little darling, I have you!”
And the man went down on his hands and knees
to get the prize from under the net.</p>

<p>“Well, wouldn’t that make you&mdash;” began Ned,
as he eased up on his foot pressure, and shut off
the power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>What he started to say he never finished, for
Jerry cried out:</p>

<p>“If that isn’t Professor Uriah Snodgrass, I’ll
drink a pint of gasolene!”</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that? Were you calling me?”
asked the little man in a mild voice, looking up
sideways from his kneeling position on the ground.
“Who wants Professor Snodgrass?” he inquired,
peering through his spectacles.</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of the boys, who were
alighting from the car. Over his face there came
a smile of welcome. He got up, holding in a section
of the net, carefully gathered up in his fingers,
the red butterfly.</p>

<p>“Well of all the good luck!” cried the professor.
“Here I meet my friends the motor boys
again, when I least expect it. One moment, my
dear boys, until I have put this specimen safely
away, and I’ll be with you. Well, of all the
strange and remarkable coincidences! I was just
thinking of you, when I saw this butterfly dart out
of the bushes, and of course, I took after it.”</p>

<p>“And nearly made an end to your collecting fad
forever,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“We nearly ran you down,” explained Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that? A mere trifle!” said the odd little
scientist. “I run chances like that half a dozen
times a day. I would risk almost anything for
such a specimen. And what would I not risk if I
could find the prize I am after?”</p>

<p>“Are you after something new?” asked Bob, as
he watched Mr. Snodgrass carefully put away in
the cyanide bottle the red butterfly.</p>

<p>“Yes, something very new,” answered Mr.
Snodgrass. “I have been commissioned by the
museum, for which I collect specimens, to get them
a singing fish.”</p>

<p>“A singing fish?” cried Ned, thinking it was a
joke.</p>

<p>“A singing fish,” replied the scientist. “That
is, it does not exactly sing, but when taken from
the water it makes a peculiar sound. It is said to
be the only fish that does this. But, in addition,
it has the power of flying for short distances out
of the water, and it can also swell itself up to
about twice its natural size. So you see it is a
very valuable specimen to get, and very, very
rare.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t find it on land,” objected Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, my dear boy,” admitted the professor, as
he shook hands with his friends, “but I expect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
shortly make a trip on the ocean. Then I hope to
get my singing fish. I wish you boys were going
on some voyage, and I could go with you.”</p>

<p>“We are going on a trip, but it’s mostly a land
trip,” explained Ned. “We may use the airship,
though. It all depends; and if Jerry carries out
his plans, and attaches the hydroplanes, we might
make a sea trip, but that’s all in the air as yet.
We’re looking for a certain man.”</p>

<p>“And I’m searching for a rare fish,” went on
the scientist. “At odd times I collect whatever
specimens come in my way.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing in this part of the country?”
asked Ned. “I thought you were in
Boston.”</p>

<p>“So I am, but I heard of a man out this way
who knows the habits of the singing fish, and I
want to get some information from him. So I
came on, and, as the man was not at home I improved
my opportunity by strolling out into the
country to see what I could find.</p>

<p>“I have been very fortunate; I find the red butterfly,
and I meet my former friends. Both are
most delightful surprises. But, may I ask, who is
the man you are seeking?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wescott Jackson,” answered Ned, after
a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wescott Jackson! Not the wealthy promoter?”
cried Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“That’s the man,” declared Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t odd!” exclaimed the scientist.
“Why I know him. In fact, he and I are
great friends. He is one of the trustees of the
museum where I am employed, and I once did
him a great favor, in getting him a certain old rare
Aztec altar, for he collects antiques. Yes, I know
Mr. Jackson quite well.”</p>

<p>“Then you are the very man for us!” cried Ned
in great delight. “Here, we can’t lose sight of
you. Hop into the auto, professor. You help us
locate Mr. Jackson, and we’ll help you get the
singing fish! Is that a bargain?”</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass gazed through his spectacles at
the boys for a moment.</p>

<p>“It is!” he exclaimed suddenly, as he got up
into the auto; and Ned started off the machine.</p>

<small>NODDY NIXON MAKES TROUBLE</small></h2>


<p>“Hold on a moment, boys! Stop the car. Jam
on the emergency brake, or whatever you call it.
I must get out! Quick!”</p>

<p>Thus cried Professor Snodgrass about half an
hour after he had entered the auto with the boys.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Ned, doing as
requested, and bringing the machine to a sudden
stop. “Have you lost your hat, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Easy now! Don’t talk or move! Keep perfectly
quiet!” Speaking in a whisper, the scientist
slid from his seat with his small butterfly
net in his hand. Gliding forward like a hunter intent
on making a shot at big game, the little man,
his eyes fairly glaring through his spectacles,
made his way cautiously to a small bush beside the
roadway.</p>

<p>“What’s he after now?” asked Jerry with a
hopeless look at his companions.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. A new kind of five-legged bug
or a reddish-green hoptoad,” whispered back Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for, though they were very fond of their friend
the professor, they could not help, at times, cracking
jokes concerning his pursuit after his quarry.</p>

<p>“Please don’t make a move!” called the scientist
to the boys, without looking around. “I’ll
have the beauty in a moment now!”</p>

<p>“If he keeps this up,” commented Ned, “we’ll
never get to Durham in time to catch Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Bob.</p>

<p>“But we need the professor’s help,” argued
Jerry, “and if he knows Mr. Jackson, the latter
may receive us better than he would if we came
alone, and he may sign the papers more readily,
Ned.”</p>

<p>“In that case I’ll stop the machine at every mile-post,
and let the professor catch bugs to his heart’s
content,” declared the merchant’s son, for he was
very much in earnest in his efforts to aid his father.</p>

<p>“Ah! There he is! I have him!” suddenly
exclaimed the professor, as he made a swoop with
his net. The next minute he was holding a small
portion of the flimsy cloth in his fingers, and inspecting
at close range some fluttering captive.</p>

<p>“What is it?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is it a valuable specimen?” Bob wanted to
know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a three-winged&mdash;oh, pshaw! No, it isn’t
either! I’ve made a mistake!” exclaimed Mr.
Snodgrass in disappointed tones. “It’s not the
kind I want at all&mdash;they’re too common,” and with
a sigh he opened the net and let fly out some sort
of a bug or insect.</p>

<p>“What was the trouble?” asked Ned, as he
started the motor on the spark, and waited for the
professor to retake his seat.</p>

<p>“I thought I had a three-winged dragon-fly,”
replied the professor. “I caught a glimpse of him
perched on a bush as we were dashing by, but
when I had him in the net I saw that he had four
wings, and was of the ordinary variety. A three-winged
dragon-fly would be a rarity, and worth
considerable, but the ones with four wings are
worthless. Well, better luck next time,” and with
that the scientist got in, and the auto was started.</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass once more began eagerly to
scan the bushes on either side of the road, hoping
for a sight of some other prize in the insect line,
while the boys talked among themselves about the
prospects of meeting Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you are ready to go off with us
on a trip, Professor?” asked Jerry, when he and
his chums had spoken of the possibility of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a voyage in the motorship. “We can’t tell where
we’ll end up in this chase, though.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go anywhere you go,” was the quick reply,
but the little man never took his eyes off the
bushes, for he was ever on the alert for specimens.</p>

<p>They rode forward for some time longer, thoroughly
enjoying the trip, and then, as it was getting
late and they wanted to take the car to the
garage to have it put in shape for the trip to Durham
the following day, they turned back, and
made a quick run to Cresville.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” called Mr. Slade after the party
as the auto chugged off the next morning, the professor
being on hand early.</p>

<p>They were to be gone at least three days, for
it would take one day to go to Durham, another,
or perhaps two, to negotiate with Mr. Jackson,
provided they could find him, and still another day
to come home. They would put up at a hotel in
the meanwhile.</p>

<p>It was a fine day, the auto was in good shape,
and, on the hard roads they made good time. Of
course Professor Snodgrass was ready with his
net, and on the lookout for any prizes he might
spy, but the boys hoped he would not stop too
often, and delay them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>They had covered perhaps thirty miles, and
were bowling along at fast speed, Mr. Snodgrass
being a little disappointed that he had not seen
anything worth capturing, when, as they swung
around a turn in the road, they saw, just ahead of
them, a place where a ditch was being dug along
the highway, to allow the laying of pipes. Dirt
had been thrown up on either side of the road,
leaving only a narrow path for the auto to pass
through.</p>

<p>“Look out for that spot, Jerry,” called Ned to
the tall lad, who was steering.</p>

<p>“All right,” was the ready response, and the
speed of the car was somewhat checked.</p>

<p>“Can you make it?” asked Bob. “It looks
pretty narrow to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do it,” answered Jerry, but, as he
came nearer, and saw how very narrow the opening
was, he brought the car to a stop. “Whoever
did this excavating had lots of nerve to take
up so much of the road,” he went on, as he got out
to measure the space more carefully. “They’ve
gone off and left it, and I don’t see any signs that
they have lights here at night. It would be a bad
place to get to after dark.”</p>

<p>While he was looking at the obstruction they
were all startled by hearing the sound of an auto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
horn, blown with an energy and persistence that
seemed to be a protest at their occupancy of the
road.</p>

<p>“Some one’s in a hurry,” commented Ned, and,
looking down the road, in the direction in which
they were going, they saw coming toward them an
auto containing two figures. It advanced swiftly.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Look out! Stop!” yelled Jerry,
holding up a warning hand. “I don’t believe
there’s room to pass!”</p>

<p>In spite of his injunction the other machine
came on until, the occupants getting near enough
to see the narrow pass, they brought the car to an
abrupt stop. When it halted the three motor boys
uttered a simultaneous exclamation at the sight of
the occupants of the car.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” gasped Ned, and his chums
echoed his words.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” snarled the bully. “Isn’t
this a free country? Can’t I go where I like?”</p>

<p>They did not take the trouble to answer him,
but gazed at the man seated beside him.</p>

<p>“Bill Berry,” murmured Jerry. “Here’s a fine
chance for trouble, and I shouldn’t be surprised if
we got some of it.”</p>

<p>“Back up your car, and let me pass!” insolently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
demanded Noddy, as he prepared to throw in
his gears and start ahead. So close was the vehicle
of our friends to the narrow passage that
there was not room for the other car to get by.
“Back up!” went on the bully. “What right have
you to block the highway?”</p>

<p>“The same right that you have!” fired back
Jerry. “We don’t want to block it up, but we were
here first, and it’s your place to reverse and let us
past.”</p>

<p>“Reverse nothing!” muttered Bill Berry. “Run
’em down, Noddy, if they won’t let you by.”</p>

<p>“I will!” declared the bully. “You’d better
back up!” he called out, threateningly.</p>

<p>“Don’t give in to him,” urged Ned in a low
voice to his tall chum.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there room for us to pass him?” inquired
Bob, for Noddy’s car was a little farther back
from the obstruction than was that of our heroes.
“I think you can make it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty tight squeeze, but I’ll chance it if
I have to.”</p>

<p>“Well, are you going to back up, and let me
pass?” demanded Noddy again. “You’d better
or I’ll smash into you!”</p>

<p>“Just try it!” retorted Jerry, a flush mounting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to his cheeks. “It’ll be the last smash you ever
make!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you be decent, Noddy?” asked
Ned, in what was intended to be conciliatory
tones. “You can back up easier than we can; and
besides, we were here first. Why don’t you do
it?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t want to. I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“So are we,” said Ned, as he thought of the
necessity for seeing Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>“Come on,” spoke Jerry in a low voice to his
chums as he turned to reënter the car, for they
had all left it, including Mr. Snodgrass, who was
eagerly looking about in the bushes for some rare
insect. “Get back to your seats,” went on the tall
lad, “and I’ll try to get through. It’s the only way
to do with such a chap as Noddy.”</p>

<p>“What about the professor?” asked Bob in a
low voice, for the scientist was some distance away
from the car now, having walked back along the
road. “If we call to him Noddy will hear us, and
guess what we’re up to.”</p>

<p>“Wait until we get past, and then we can stop
and wait for Mr. Snodgrass,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“Good idea,” commented Jerry. “Hop in
lively now!”</p>

<p>They were in their seats a moment later, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Jerry very luckily started the engine on the spark.</p>

<p>“Here! What are you going to do?” yelled
Noddy, as he caught the chugging of the motor.</p>

<p>“We’re going on,” replied Jerry calmly, as he
threw in the gear. As he let the clutch slip into
place, the car suddenly shot ahead.</p>

<p>“They’re going to ram, you Noddy!” yelled
Bill Berry. “Look out!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort! We’re going to try to
pass,” called back Ned.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Noddy!” cried Bill.</p>

<p>“Look out or there’ll be a collision!” cautioned
Bob, for Noddy’s machine was also trying to slip
into the narrow passage ahead of the car of our
friends.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are!” warned Jerry. “I can
make it if you stand still for a second!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to!” flared up Noddy, and
as the tall lad urged his car toward the little strip
of roadway between the piles of dirt, steering with
skill, the bully also sent his machine toward the
same place.</p>

<p>A head-on collision seemed imminent, and for
an instant Jerry’s heart failed him. He was about
to jam on the brakes and stop, when he saw that
by putting on a spurt of speed he could just
make it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>His foot pressed the accelerator pedal, and
with a snort, the auto of the motor boys shot
ahead through a narrow opening.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted Ned. “You’ll have us in
the ditch, Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry gave the steering wheel a quick twist to
get clear of the ditch, and also to avoid running
into Noddy’s car which was now forging toward
him.</p>

<p>He just managed to pass by, and was steering
back on the road again, when, before he could
possibly avoid it, a little spotted calf dashed out
of a lane leading into the highway.</p>

<p>The small animal, with a bleat, got directly in
the path of the auto of our friends, and stood
there with its legs far apart.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted Ned. “You’ll hit it,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>But it was too late. The force acquired from
the sudden spurt could not be overcome in an instant,
even though Jerry jammed on both brakes
with all his force.</p>

<p>A moment later he hit the calf squarely and the
unfortunate little creature went down in the road,
under the car.</p>

<small>“STUNG!”</small></h2>


<p>“Here, hold on there! Stop that gasolene contraption!
I’ll have th’ law on ye fer runnin’ down
my calf-critter! What right ye got t’ go racin’
around th’ land killin’ a poor man’s critters right
an’ left? Hold on, I’ll sue ye fer damages!”</p>

<p>A grizzled old man, wearing a pair of ragged
overalls, with a ragged blue jacket to match, and
with a bunch of white whiskers on his chin wiggling
up and down as he shouted the above words,
rushed down the lane out of which the spotted
calf had come, and shook his fist at the lads in the
auto.</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” he repeated.</p>

<p>“We are holding on,” remarked Jerry grimly,
as he got out and looked under the car at the calf.</p>

<p>The creature had not been touched by the
wheels, but lay between them. Unnaturally still
it lay, nor did it bleat or give a sign of life. Jerry
took hold of the tail, and was about to pull it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
out, hoping it was not much hurt, though his heart
misgave him.</p>

<p>“Here, what ye goin’ t’ do?” demanded the
angry farmer.</p>

<p>“I was going to pull the calf out from under
our car,” replied Jerry. “It&mdash;it fell there.”</p>

<p>“Humph! A likely story. I saw ye deliberately
run down my calf-critter. You let it alone
until I git some witnesses, an’ prove a case agin
ye! Let it alone!”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s dead, anyhow,” said Ned in a low
voice, as he stood beside Jerry.</p>

<p>“Deader than a lobster,” added Bob. “You
must have hit it an awful poke, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, can’t you?” urged Ned. “This
skinflint of a farmer will hear you,” for the man
was gazing at the trio of lads with angry eyes.</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon, with a look of triumphant gloating
on his face, came forward, followed by Bill
Berry. Professor Snodgrass, oblivious to everything
save his favorite pursuit, was some distance
down the road, using his net with energy.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hit it hard at all,” Jerry said. “The
calf ran right across the road. Why I hardly
struck it at all. I had the brakes on ready to stop,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me about brakes!” snapped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
farmer. “Ye broke my calf’s neck, an’ it was a
valuable critter. Don’t ye dare touch it till I git
some witnesses, an’ prove a case on ye. I want
damages, an’ heavy damages, too! I want witnesses.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be witnesses for you!” broke in Noddy
eagerly. “It was entirely the fault of those fellows
that your calf was killed, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.&mdash;?”
he paused suggestively.</p>

<p>“Sackett is my name&mdash;Ebenezer Sackett, of
Tewkesbury Township,” supplied the farmer. “I
live right over that way a short piece, jest below
th’ hill. I was drivin’ my calf down the lane, when
all to onct this rip-snortin’ ragin’ and tearin’ automobile
comes along an’ kills him. I want damages,
an’ heavy damages, too!”</p>

<p>“We saw them kill the calf,” went on Noddy,
seemingly eager to array himself against the
motor boys, and on the side of the farmer.
“Didn’t we, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Sure we did,” answered the bully’s crony.</p>

<p>“Then you must have very good eyesight,” remarked
Jerry cuttingly, “for you were in your car,
and how you could observe the calf, when it is so
small that it doesn’t come to the top of our radiator,
is more than I can understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, we saw it just the same, Mr. Sackett,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
went on the ugly bully. “They killed your animal,
and you ought to make them pay for it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I intend,” asserted the farmer.
“I’ll attach their machine, that’s what I’ll do ef
they don’t pay. Hi there, Abner!” he called, as a
man, evidently one of the hired help, came hurrying
along the lane. “Abner, you go notify Constable
Higbie that I got a case fer him. I want
these fellers arrested fer killin’ my spotted calf!”</p>

<p>“Gosh all hemlock!” cried Abner, as he stared
at the scene before him.</p>

<p>“You go git th’ constable,” repeated Mr. Sackett,
“an’ I’ll hold these fellers until you come back
with him. I’ll show ’em that they can’t monkey
with Ebenezer Sackett of Tewkesbury Township.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it against the law to let animals run at
large on the highway?” asked Ned of Mr. Sackett.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t runnin’ at large,” was the answer.
“I was leading him, an’ he broke away from me.
Ye can’t git out of it that way. I want damages
an’ I’m goin’ t’ have ’em! Th’ constable will be
here soon, an’ ye kin take yer choice of payin’ or
goin’ t’ jail.”</p>

<p>How long this dispute might have been kept up
it is difficult to say, but Professor Snodgrass arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
just then, and, hearing the story, endeavored
to conciliate the angry farmer. But there
was no subduing Mr. Sackett.</p>

<p>“I want damages!” he declared firmly.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, there’s only one way to end this,”
said Ned finally, putting his hand in his pocket.
“It wasn’t our fault, but I suppose we’ve got to
stand being gouged by this fellow. I’ll pay him,
Jerry, as this trip is on my father’s account, and
then we can get along. How much was your
calf worth, Mr. Sackett?”</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars ef he was a cent!”</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars!” gasped Bob.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass,
who could be very practical on occasions. “I
know something of farm animals. Pull that calf
out, Jerry, and let’s look at him.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned grasped the tail, and soon had
the creature out in the highway. The farmer
offered no further objections to it being moved,
now that it seemed as if he was in a fair way to
collect damages.</p>

<p>“Humph! A very young calf,” commented
Mr. Snodgrass. “Hardly fit to kill for veal.
And it doesn’t seem to have been hit very hard.”</p>

<p>“No, it was a very gentle blow,” said Jerry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
“The car was almost at a standstill when he ran
into it.”</p>

<p>“It must have died easily,” went on the scientist.
“Now, Mr. Sackett, you’ll have to lower
your figure, for I know that calf was never worth
any fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s wuth forty.”</p>

<p>“Forty? Nonsense. If you sold it for fifteen
you’d be getting more than it was worth. We’ll
give you twenty dollars for the animal, and not
another cent.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not take it,” stormed the farmer.</p>

<p>“That’s right! Make ’em pay more, or sue
’em!” put in Noddy.</p>

<p>“You mind your own affairs, Nixon!” said the
professor curtly, and Noddy slunk back toward
his machine.</p>

<p>“Will you take twenty dollars, or will you let
the matter go to court?” asked the scientist, taking
some bills from his pocket, and motioning to the
boys that he would conduct the case for them.</p>

<p>“I want thirty dollars, anyhow,” said Mr.
Sackett. “Ha! Here comes Abner with the
constable. Now we’ll see what happens.”</p>

<p>“Offer him twenty-five, and I think he’ll take
it,” said Ned in a low voice. “We can’t stay here
any longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, if you say so,” agreed the professor,
“but I think I could get him down to twenty.
Well, Mr. Sackett,” went on the scientist, “we’ll
pay you twenty-five dollars, and not another cent.
If that’s not satisfactory we’ll give the constable
a bond, and we’ll fight the case in the courts.”</p>

<p>This was said with such an air of decision that
the farmer saw that it was useless to stand out
for more.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it,” said Mr. Sackett reluctantly, “but
th’ calf was wuth forty dollars ef it was a cent.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” declared the professor, as he
paid over the money. “Haul the carcass out of
the way, and we’ll be getting on, boys.”</p>

<p>“It’s a regular case of hold-up,” muttered Ned,
as he dragged the calf farther out of the path of
the auto.</p>

<p>The farmer pocketed the money with a gleam
of satisfaction in his eyes. Noddy Nixon, looking
disappointed, perhaps because the motor boys
had not been arrested, started back to his machine,
followed by his crony, and soon they were
chugging away down the road. Our friends and
the professor entered their car.</p>

<p>“Whew! That was a hot time while it lasted!”
remarked Bob, when they had gone on some distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and all Noddy Nixon’s fault,” added
Ned.</p>

<p>“Talk about highway robbers,” declared Jerry,
“Mr. Sackett comes pretty nearly being one.”</p>

<p>They were filled with righteous anger against
Mr. Sackett, and this was added to when they
learned something about him when they stopped a
little later at a country hotel for dinner.</p>

<p>While they were waiting for the meal to be
prepared they got talking to the hotel clerk.
They mentioned their experience with Mr. Sackett,
and told of paying for the calf.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, strangers,” broke in a farmer
who was seated near a table reading, “but was
this calf you speak of a brown and white spotted
one?”</p>

<p>“It was,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“With a very long tail?” the man wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Very long,” spoke Ned, who had particularly
noted the appendage as he dragged the creature
out of the way.</p>

<p>“And was it a thin, poor-looking sort of a
calf?” went on the man.</p>

<p>“It was,” said Mr. Snodgrass. “You seem to
know this calf in question.”</p>

<p>“Know it? I guess I do!” was the answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
“And I know Eb Sackett, too. Why that calf had
been condemned by the county inspector of cattle,
an’ Eb had been ordered to kill it. Th’ calf had
some catchin’ disease, an’ Eb was under orders
t’ git rid of it inside of twenty-four hours, or pay
a fine of fifty dollars. He was takin’ it off to
shoot it, when you must have bunked into it.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of this?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Course I am, strangers. Why, I’m a deputy
cattle inspector, an’ I’m on my way now to see if
Eb carried out the orders he got. But if you
say the calf is dead there ain’t no use in me goin’
on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s dead all right,” replied Jerry with a
queer look at his chums.</p>

<p>“And we paid twenty-five dollars for the privilege
of killing a calf that had been condemned,
and would have been killed, anyhow,” murmured
Ned. “Well, if we weren’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stung!” interrupted Bob. “Stung good and
proper!”</p>

<p>“By Mr. Ebenezer Sackett,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>“I guess his name ought to be Mr. ‘Sock-it,’ instead
of Sackett,” commented the hotel clerk.
“That certainly was a swindle he worked on you,
gentlemen, and he socked it to you!”</p>

<p>“And it ain’t the fust time Eb’s done a trick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
like that, nor it won’t be the last,” spoke the
deputy cattle inspector. “I’m sorry for you boys,
an’ if you want to go back, an’ make him give
up your money, I’ll do all I can for ye.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, but we haven’t time now,” replied
Ned, as he thought of the necessity for hurrying
on to see Mr. Jackson.</p>

<small>AN UNLUCKY BLOWOUT</small></h2>


<p>“Easy marks, that’s what we are,” commented
Ned, as with his chums and Professor Snodgrass,
he sat down to dinner. “Very easy marks.”</p>

<p>“It might have happened to anyone,” declared
Jerry. “But it sure does make me sore to think
how he cheated us on that calf deal.”</p>

<p>They were still talking of Mr. Sackett, and, as
the account of the happening became generally
known in the hotel, many stories showing the
meanness of the miserly farmer were told to our
heroes. Mr. Sackett was characterized as a
“skinflint” of the worst kind.</p>

<p>They started off again, soon after dinner, and
made up for the time lost over the calf transaction
by speeding up to the limit allowed by the law,
and, in places where there were particularly good
roads, and where there were no houses, they even
exceeded the limit slightly. But their necessity
justified it.</p>

<p>“Think we’ll make Durham before dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Jerry?” asked Bob, as he noticed the sun beginning
to sink low in the west. “How much farther
is it?”</p>

<p>“The last sign-post said thirty miles,” remarked
Ned, “but if it’s anything like the usual
post, that means it will be at least forty before we
strike Durham.”</p>

<p>“In that case we won’t get in until after dark,”
was Jerry’s opinion. “But we have powerful gas
lamps, and it won’t matter much. Here, Ned,
you take the wheel a bit, I’m tired.”</p>

<p>The machine was stopped while the change was
made, and they went on again. Jerry cast several
anxious glances at a bank of clouds gathering
in the west, and Bob, also noting them, remarked:</p>

<p>“I think we’re in for a storm.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder,” agreed the tall lad. “Hit
her up for all she’s worth, Ned. Take a few
chances. I don’t believe there’ll be any speed-constables
out now.”</p>

<p>It soon became evident that they were not going
to make Durham before nightfall. In fact,
after passing one post by which they were informed
that their destination was thirty miles
farther on, the next one made it thirty-two.</p>

<p>“Say, according to that we’re going backward,”
commented Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t mind,” advised Jerry. “Keep right on,
and when we arrive we’ll be there.”</p>

<p>“Wise man,” asserted Bob with a laugh.</p>

<p>The threatened storm gathered more quickly
as the afternoon waned, and they had not gone
many more miles before the rumbling of thunder
increased, and the intermittent flashes of lightning
became almost continuous.</p>

<p>“We’re going to be in for it,” warned Bob, as
the first few splashes of rain came.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’d better stop, put up the top, and the
side curtains,” advised Ned. “I want the wind
shield up, too, for I don’t like the rain in my
face.”</p>

<p>They were soon better prepared to stand the
downpour which quickly came, and with the heavy
curtains and the top up, they were fairly snug and
comfortable in the auto, as it chugged off through
the darkness.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” suddenly grunted Ned, as he felt the
wheels leave the hard macadam road, and slip
into the soft mud of a dirt highway. “Now we’re
in for it.”</p>

<p>The auto labored on, losing time as the rain
turned the highway into a veritable slough. The
downpour got heavier, and a wind springing up,
seemed to force the water through every crack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and crevice of the protecting curtains. The lightning,
too, was incessant, and the thunder claps
came with startling rapidity.</p>

<p>“Beautiful! Beautiful!” grumbled Bob. “It’ll
soon be as black as tar, and we’ll get stuck ten
miles from nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t find fault,” advised Jerry good-naturedly.
“We may make it yet.”</p>

<p>Ned peered anxiously ahead through the mist
of rain, seeking to make out the road, which was
illuminated by the powerful gas lamps. It was
risky driving, but there was no help for it, and he
was not well acquainted with the route.</p>

<p>“Can’t you get a little more speed out of her?”
asked Jerry, when there came a lull in the storm.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to risk it,” replied the youthful
steersman. “If we happen to hit a big stone it
will be all up with us. Wow! This is Lonesomeville
for fair!”</p>

<p>They were on a dark and deserted stretch of
the road. There seemed to be no houses within
miles, and the storm was at its height.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sound like a gun shot.
The motor boys started, but well they knew what
it was.</p>

<p>“A blowout!” groaned Bob.</p>

<p>“I should say it was,” agreed Jerry grimly. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
couldn’t have happened at a worse time, either.
Where in the world are we?”</p>

<p>He peered through a crack in the curtains, out
on the dismal rain-soaked blackness, but could
make out nothing.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no help for it. It’s up to us to
put a new shoe and tube on,” spoke Ned, who
had quickly brought the car to a stop. Then the
three lads, having donned rubber coats, which
fortunately they carried with them, got out of the
car, and stood in the mud, with the rain pelting
them, while they made ready to repair the damaged
tire.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>A SURPRISED INTRUDER</small></h2>


<p>“Going to stand here looking at it all night?”
demanded Jerry after a pause, during which his
two chums had vainly sought to prevent the rain
from trickling down inside the collars of their
coats. “Do you think the tire is going to mend
itself, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I only wish it would!” devoutly exclaimed
Chunky. “Wow! This is fierce!”</p>

<p>“No help for it,” mumbled Ned, as he wiped
the dashing rain drops from his eyes. “Hand me
the jack, Jerry, I’ll get the car up, you can take
off the tire and we’ll make Bob put on the new
shoe and tube. That’s a fair division of labor.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be gum-swizzled if I can see it, as Mr.
Sackett would say,” exclaimed the fat lad. “You
give me the hardest part to do.”</p>

<p>“Good for reducing flesh,” remarked Jerry as
he reached under the seat and got out the jack
and a new inner tube. “Fetch around one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
oil headlights, Bob, so we can see what we are
doing, and unstrap a shoe.”</p>

<p>Bob started for the lantern, splashed into a
deep mud hole, and uttered an exclamation of
disgust.</p>

<p>“Wow! Say, I’m in up to my knees!” he complained.</p>

<p>“And I’m gradually sinking down,” added
Ned. “It looks as if we were in a bog, or a quicksand.
Fellows, I do believe the auto is going
down!”</p>

<p>“Hey! What’s that? The auto sinking?”
cried the voice of Professor Snodgrass. For the
time being the boys had forgotten about him, and
he seemed to have either fallen into a slumber,
or to have been thinking so deeply there in the
darkness that he was not aware of the accident.
“Don’t tell me we’re sinking!” he implored.</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re not, it’s a good imitation of it,”
declared Jerry, as he looked at the wheels of the
auto, now deep in the soft mud.</p>

<p>“Oh, what will become of my valuable specimens?”
cried the scientist. “I must save them!”
and he leaped from the auto, holding in his arms
half a dozen small boxes. He landed in a puddle
of water, which splashed all over the motor boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and their sudden exclamations of dismay further
added to the alarm of the professor.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know we had run into a river!” he
cried. “Why didn’t you warn me? I was thinking
of a plan to capture the singing fish, and I
didn’t pay any attention to where we were going.”</p>

<p>“Neither did the auto, apparently,” remarked
Ned. “But it’s not quite as bad as a river, Professor.
We’re comparatively safe. You’d better
get back under shelter, and we’ll fix the tire,”
for the little scientist was speedily being drenched,
as he stood there in the storm without a protecting
coat.</p>

<p>“Thanks. I believe I will. I wish I could help
you boys. Wait until I put my boxes where they
won’t get wet, and I’ll do what I can.” The
professor reëntered the car.</p>

<p>“No, we’ll manage,” declared Jerry. “Get
busy with the jack, if you’re going to, Ned.”</p>

<p>The merchant’s son went around to the wheel
on which the tire had burst, and stooped down in
the mud and water, while Bob held the lantern.
The wind blew more powerfully, fairly stinging
the rain into the faces of our heroes. They were
deep in the muck, and even their raincoats were
but small protection.</p>

<p>Ned tried to slip the jack under the axle, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the foot of the implement went so far down into
the mud that no purchase, or lifting power, could
be obtained.</p>

<p>“Get me a flat stone, or several of them, or a
fence rail, or something to put under the jack,”
ordered Ned, straightening up with a groan of anguish.
“I’ve got to have something to set it on.
Get busy, Chunky! Look around with your lantern
for a flat rock.”</p>

<p>“Say, do you think I’m going to do it all?”
demanded the stout lad in injured tones.</p>

<p>“You haven’t done anything yet,” retorted Ned
sharply. The storm and the accident was getting
on the nerves of all of them, and tempers were
sorely tried.</p>

<p>“Here, Bob, I’ll help,” broke in Jerry good-naturedly,
with the intention of pouring oil on
troubled waters. “I’ll get the other lantern and
we’ll give an imitation of two Diogeneses looking
for a flat stone.”</p>

<p>As the tall lad made his way forward, splashing
through the mud and water to detach the other
headlight, Professor Snodgrass, who had safely
packed away his specimen boxes, uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Look, boys!” he called, “there’s a light coming
this way. Maybe it’s another auto, and they’ll
help you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>They all looked. Down the road, dimly seen
through the mist of the rain, was a bobbing light.</p>

<p>“If that’s an auto it’s either got the blind staggers,
or else it’s steering itself,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s a man with a lantern,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“And he’s coming this way,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” went on Ned, throwing the
jack back into the tonneau.</p>

<p>“Settles what?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“This repair job. I’m going to wait until
morning. We can’t do anything in the storm and
darkness.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do? Stay out here all
night, stuck in the mud?” asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>“We’re going to stay stuck in the mud all right,
I guess, fellows,” retorted Ned, as he watched
the progress of the moving light, “but we’re not
going to stay out here all night, not to my way of
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Where are you going?” inquired
Bob. “Do you see a hotel off in the distance?”
and he pretended to look like the villain in the
play, who shades his eyes with his hand and
gazes down the wings, for a sight of some one approaching
on horseback.</p>

<p>“Here’s how I size it up,” went on Ned.
“There’s a man coming with a light. He’s walking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
so evidently he doesn’t live far from here, or
he’d be riding. If he lives around here there
must be some sort of a house, and when he gets
here I’m going to ask him to take us in. I’d be
willing to sleep in a stable to get out of this storm.
We can leave the auto here, and in the morning
we can put on a new tire, and start off. How
about it?”</p>

<p>“It sounds good to me, if the man will take us
in,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“You’ll soon be able to tell,” remarked the
professor. “He’s almost here.”</p>

<p>The bobbing light approached nearer, and
soon, by its rays, the boys could see that the lantern
was carried by a grizzled farmer, who wore
a horse blanket as a raincoat. He stopped, and
standing in a puddle of water demanded:</p>

<p>“Are ye stuck, strangers?”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Can you accommodate us over night?” asked
Ned quickly. “We’re willing to pay you well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I could put you up,” drawled the
man. “I live all alone, jest a piece down the
road. I saw the lights on your machine, an’ I
sensed that suthin’ were wrong, so I come out t’
help. This is a powerful bad bit of road, an’ lots
of machines has trouble. Generally they comes t’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
me fer help an’ I does what I kin. If ye’ll walk
along I’ll light th’ way, though it’s a measly bad
storm.”</p>

<p>“Will it be safe to leave the auto here, boys?”
asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Jerry. “No one could run
away with it to-night, but I’ll take the precaution
of locking the ignition system, and that will prevent
anyone tampering with it. I guess we’ll go
with you, Mr.&mdash;” He paused and looked at the
farmer.</p>

<p>“Buttle is my name, Enoch Buttle. Come right
along. I ain’t got a very scrumptious place, but
ye’re welcome.”</p>

<p>“I must get my valuables!” exclaimed the professor
suddenly, as he reached back under the
seat where he had piled his specimen boxes. “It
would never do to leave them here.” As he
emerged with the small packages in his arms,
shielding them from the wet as well as he could,
Mr. Buttle looked at the scientist sharply, and
asked:</p>

<p>“Suthin’ ye’re particularly fond of there, neighbor?”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.
“There’s at least a thousand dollars in these
boxes.” He referred to his valuation of his specimens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
A sharp and crafty look passed over the
farmer’s face. It was gone in an instant, and
before the boys, who were busy getting the auto
in shape to leave standing on the road, had had
a chance to notice the expression.</p>

<p>Splashing down the muddy road the four followed
the lead of the farmer, and his bobbing lantern.
The red tail light of the auto, as well as
the two oil headlights had been left burning, so
that no other traveller would crash into the obstruction.</p>

<p>Rather discouraged by their plight, pretty well
wet through, anxious about getting an early start
in the morning, there was no very cheerful spirit
manifested among our friends as they trudged on.
Professor Snodgrass carried his boxes, oblivious
to everything else, even the pelting rain, which
soaked him through. Jerry wanted the scientist
to take his stormcoat, but Mr. Snodgrass would
not hear of such a thing.</p>

<p>“Keep it yourself, Jerry,” he said. “I’m used
to being wet through in my business. I’ll soon
dry out when we get to Mr. Buttle’s house.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I carry your valuables for you?” asked
the farmer who was walking beside Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no indeed! I never let anyone but myself
take these precious things,” replied the scientist.
“If anything should happen to them I
never could replace them.”</p>

<p>A little later they were at the farmhouse. It
was a small one, quite old-fashioned, and, from
what little glimpse the boys had of it as they entered,
it did not seem to be in very good repair.</p>

<p>“Here’s where I live,” said Mr. Buttle. “It’s
not very good, but it’s the best I’ve got. Now I
can make you a cup of coffee, and fry some ham
and eggs, if you’d like ’em.”</p>

<p>“Would we?” cried Bob, and there was a hungry
gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’ll git right t’ work. I do my own
cookin’. I’ve got an oil stove. Git off your
things, an’ I’ll git th’ meal. I dunno whether
we’ll call it supper or brekfust, but it don’t much
matter. I’ll be right back, an’ after ye eat I’ll
make ye up some beds on th’ floor. It’s the best
I kin do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be glad to get them,” said Ned, “no
matter what they are.”</p>

<p>The old man, with a quick glance at Professor
Snodgrass, bustled from the room, and our
friends proceeded to take off some of their wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
garments, hanging them over chairs near an old-fashioned
fire-place in which, in spite of the fact
that it was summer, a blaze was cheerfully burning.</p>

<p>“This will dry us out,” observed Jerry, holding
his benumbed hands to the flames.</p>

<p>“That’s right, git close to th’ fire,” remarked
Mr. Buttle, as he came in a little later, leaving
open the kitchen door, whence came the savory
smell of ham and eggs, mingling with coffee. “I
lit th’ fire when the storm come up.”</p>

<p>“Say, does it strike you that our host hasn’t
the most pleasant face in the world?” asked Jerry
of his chums, when the old man had again gone
out.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t look gift-horses in the mouth,”
observed Ned.</p>

<p>“You can’t see his mouth&mdash;too many whiskers,”
came from Bob with a chuckle. “I’m glad
we’re going to feed, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“No, but seriously, I don’t like his looks,”
went on the tall lad. “If we had any valuables
I’d feel like putting them under my pillow, provided
we get one when we go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re nervous,” declared Ned, and then
conversation on that line came to an end, for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Buttle announced supper. It was as good a meal
as could be expected under the circumstances, and
the boys and the professor did full justice to it.</p>

<p>“An’ now for beds,” announced their host, and
a little later, having been gone from the room for
some time, he came back to state that the sleeping,
arrangements were completed.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to put you three young fellows on
beds on th’ floor in one room,” he said, “an’ Mr.
Snodgrass kin have th’ next room. It’s the best
I kin do.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we all be together?” asked Jerry, with
a suspicious glance at his companions.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but my house ain’t quite big
enough,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” Professor Snodgrass hastened
to say. “I’ll take all my valuables in with
me, for I wouldn’t want anything to happen to
them. I’ll be all right, and we can leave the door
open between.”</p>

<p>Jerry felt that it would hardly be right to say
anything more, and so, in about half an hour,
when they were nearly dried out before the welcome
blaze, they went up to the improvised bedrooms.</p>

<p>“I thought you said we could have the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
open between our room and the professor’s?”
asked Jerry when he had looked at the arrangements.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I did think so, but I jest discovered
that th’ connectin’ door is locked, an’ I can’t find
th’ key,” said Mr. Buttle, nervously moving
about.</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t matter,” was the professor’s
opinion, and he went into his apartment carrying
with him his precious boxes of specimens, while
Jerry, with growing suspicion, caught a crafty
look which Mr. Buttle gave the scientist.</p>

<p>“Lock your door, Professor,” whispered the
tall lad, as they prepared for bed. “Lock it, and
put a chair against it.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Mr. Snodgrass. “Do
you think&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of that man,” went on
Jerry. “Put your watch and money under your
head. We’ll do the same.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re too fussy,” declared Bob, as the
footsteps of their host could be heard descending
the stairs, after he had called a “good-night” to
them. “You’re nervous, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I am, but I’m going to lock our
door just the same. No use taking chances.”</p>

<p>Jerry did so, and also took the precaution to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
draw a chair against the portal. He called to
know if Mr. Snodgrass had done the same.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the scientist, “though I have no
fear. My watch is only a cheap one, and I didn’t
bring much money with me. I will put my specimen
boxes where no one can get at them without
awakening me.”</p>

<p>In spite of his worries Jerry was soon asleep,
as were the others, for they were tired and worn
out. Ned was thinking anxiously of what the
morrow might bring forth, and he hoped soon to
be in communication with Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>Just what hour it was Jerry could not determine,
but he was suddenly awakened by a noise as
if some one had pushed a chair across the room.
Instantly all his suspicions came back to him, but,
before arousing his companions he made up his
mind to investigate.</p>

<p>Cautiously he crawled to the door of their
room, and, feeling about in the darkness, discovered
that the chair he had placed against the
portal was still in place.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t in here,” he murmured. “I wonder
if the professor is up?” He was just about to
rouse Ned and Bob, and had in mind to call the
scientist, when from the latter’s apartment there
suddenly came a series of startled yells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ouch! Oh my! Let go! I’m bein’ stabbed!
Some beast has holt of me! Let go, consarn ye,
or I’ll stomp on ye!”</p>

<p>There was a riot of racket in the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” yelled Ned, jumping up.</p>

<p>“Is the place on fire?” asked Bob, pressing
the spring of a portable electric light he had with
him, and partly illuminating the room.</p>

<p>“Here! Get out! What are you doing?
Thieves! Murder! Help, boys, help!”</p>

<p>“It’s the professor!” gasped Jerry. “That
rascal is attacking him!”</p>

<p>“We’re coming, Professor!” sung out Ned.
He began sliding back the chair that Jerry had
placed against the door, while Bob held the light.</p>

<p>“Not that way! This!” shouted Jerry, and,
putting his shoulder to the connecting door, he
burst it open with a mighty shove.</p>

<p>The three chums piled into the professor’s
room, and in the light of Bob’s lamp saw a curious
sight.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">Dancing about in fear and pain was Mr. Buttle.</a>
Fast to the thumb of each hand was an enormous,
pinching, black beetle, some of the specimens recently
gathered by the professor. The boxes were
scattered about the room, and the scientist with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
apprehension on his face was scurrying about,
gathering up several choice insects which had been
released by the intruder.</p>

<p>“Take these beasts off me or I’ll sue ye!” cried
Mr. Buttle. “Take ’em away ’fore they eat my
thumbs off! Wow! Jehoshaphat, how they
pinch!”</p>

<small>A DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments the boys stood there almost
spellbound, gazing at the startled farmer, on
whose face the look of pain increased.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” demanded Jerry, when
the intruder into the professor’s room had succeeded
in shaking off the two beetles, and was
looking critically at his injured thumbs. The insects
had drawn blood.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” answered the professor,
as he made a grab for a large bug that
was trying to get down a crack, for some of the
scientist’s specimens were very lively. “I’m sure I
don’t know. I was sleeping peacefully, when I
was suddenly awakened by this man shouting.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to get the beetles?” asked
Jerry, looking severely at Mr. Buttle.</p>

<p>“I didn’t git ’em, they got me,” he declared.
“Th’ consarned critters pinch wuss than lobsters.”</p>

<p>“They <em>are</em> a form of land lobster,” the professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
explained as he carefully caught the two
beetles in a box and closed the lid. “But I don’t
see how they got out. I had the top securely
closed.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mr. Buttle can explain,” remarked
Ned significantly. That individual squirmed uneasily.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I got t’ thinkin’ in th’ night, that maybe
th’ professor might need a drink of water,”
explained the farmer, “’count of him eatin’ so
much ham. So I brung some water up. There’s
the pitcher,” and he pointed to one, in proof of
his assertion. “I knocked on th’ door,” he went
on, “but th’ professor didn’t answer, an’ then I
thought it’d be a pity to wake him up. So I
thought I’d jest push th’ door open, an’ leave th’
water where he could git it.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I done so, an’ I were jest leavin’ when
them two big black bugs jumped out of th’ darkness
an’ grabbed me. Then I let out a yell.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we heard you yell,” spoke Bob gently,
and Ned felt like laughing, only the matter
seemed to be too serious.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how those horned beetles could get
out when the boxes were tightly fastened,” observed
the professor simply.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, they got out all right, an’ they got on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
me,” went on the farmer. “Ef I git blood poison
I’ll have t’ sue ye.”</p>

<p>“You had no right to come in the room of Mr.
Snodgrass without knocking, or telling him,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to wake him up, when I brought
in th’ water. An’ look at my door&mdash;all busted!”
proceeded the farmer indignantly, looking at the
portal Jerry had smashed. “Somebody’s got t’
pay fer that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll settle,” agreed Jerry, and then, as
if fearing he might be asked embarrassing questions,
Mr. Buttle suddenly departed, tramping
indignantly down the stairs, and muttering meanwhile
something about “crazy automobile folks
thet carried wild animals with ’em!”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think, fellows?” asked
Ned, as they stood looking at each other in the
dim illumination of the electric light Bob held.</p>

<p>“It looks rather funny,” declared the stout
youth.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have been funny if my specimens
had gotten away,” observed the scientist. “He
knocked down the whole pile of boxes at my head,
and that’s how some of them must have come
open.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s not the way,” was Jerry’s opinion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
“I’ll tell you what I think. I believe our host is
a dangerous character, and I think he sneaked up,
hoping the professor had money in those boxes.
He was going to rob him, but the beetles turned
the trick.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” inquired Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” replied the tall lad.</p>

<p>“And I agree with him,” added Ned. “I remember
now that the professor spoke of his ‘valuables’
in the boxes, and I saw Mr. Buttle looking
at him rather sharply. That’s just how it was.
He thought he was going to make a good haul.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky we weren’t all murdered in our
sleep,” exclaimed Bob, with a nervous look
around.</p>

<p>“Oh, hardly as bad as that, I think,” came
from Jerry. “However, Mr. Buttle has had his
lesson, and I think he won’t sneak around us
again. He must have unlocked the professor’s
door with a duplicate key, and when he pushed
the chair across the floor that woke me up.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s explanation was accepted, and they
went back to bed, but it was some time before
they got to sleep. When Jerry awoke again it
was just getting light, and as he was as anxious
as was Ned to be on the road again, he roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his companions. Professor Snodgrass was already
up, making a careful inspection of his specimen
boxes by daylight, to see if any of the bugs
had escaped. He found them all intact.</p>

<p>“What shall we do; take chances on having
breakfast with Mr. Buttle?” asked Ned, as they
were ready to go down stairs.</p>

<p>“I vote that we pay him what we owe him, and
go on to the next town for breakfast,” spoke Ned.
“We can put the tire on, and make good time.
It’s stopped raining.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m pretty hungry,” remarked Bob with
a woebegone face, “and it’s no fun putting on a
tire without your breakfast, but I wouldn’t want
him to poison us, and he might do it to get
even.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start off and hunt our own breakfast,”
decided Jerry. When they went downstairs
they found no signs of their host. Evidently he
did not care to meet them face to face in daylight.
So, after leaving where he would see it a sum of
money sufficient to pay for their supper and the
night’s lodging, and also to repair the broken
door, our friends departed. Jerry left a note,
stating what the money was for.</p>

<p>They found their auto undisturbed, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
had the tire repaired. They kept a lookout for
the farmer, whom they believed to be a rascal, but
saw no signs of him, and made good time to the
next town, where they got a good breakfast at
the hotel. There, having mentioned the fact that
they had spent the night with Mr. Buttle, they
were told that they had taken a big chance.</p>

<p>“That fellow’s a regular hold-up man,” said
the hotel clerk. “He makes a practice of swindling
autoists. It’s been said that he puts tacks
and glass in the road, so they’ll get damaged tires
right in front of his place, and then when they
halt to make repairs, he comes out and offers to
sell food at about three times the market prices.
That’s the way he makes his living, instead of
farming it. He ‘grafts’ on the autoists.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll be careful how he tackles this party
another time,” remarked Jerry significantly.</p>

<p>They had left bad roads behind, and now, spinning
over hard and smooth highways, they found
themselves, a little after nine o’clock that morning,
in the city of Durham.</p>

<p>“Now for Mr. Jackson!” cried Ned, as they
inquired the way to the sanitarium where the millionaire
operator was staying.</p>

<p>Up the broad road, through the entrance gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
went our heroes. The place was attractively laid
out, and was quite celebrated as a health resort
for overworked men and women of the wealthy
and fashionable class.</p>

<p>“We’ll let you do the talking, at first, Professor,”
decided Ned, as he guided the car around
the turns in the road.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be glad to meet my friend Mr. Jackson
again. I think&mdash;hold on just a moment, Ned.
I think I see a rare kind of beetle.”</p>

<p>The boys were in a hurry, but the memory of
the good service the professor’s beetles had done
the previous night made them willing to stop the
car. Mr. Snodgrass got out, and succeeded in
capturing a bug, the possession of which seemed
to give him great delight. Then Ned speeded
up the machine as the latest specimen was carefully
put away.</p>

<p>They came to a halt in front of a sort of hotel-sanitarium,
and Ned and Mr. Snodgrass went to
the front door.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I’m real sorry, but you’ve had
your trip for nothing,” the manager informed
them, when they had stated whom they wished to
see.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t Mr. Jackson here?” asked Ned
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was here, up to last night. But he went
away suddenly, and he won’t be back.”</p>

<p>“Where has he gone?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Out to the big airship and balloon meet at
Danforth.”</p>

<p>“To a balloon meet?” repeated Ned in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. Didn’t you know that Mr. Jackson was
an enthusiastic balloonist and aviator?”</p>

<p>“I knew he had many fads,” spoke the professor,
“but I didn’t know he included ballooning
among them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” went on the manager. “He is much
interested in all sorts of air craft. In fact he
talked of nothing else while he was here. He has
invented some sort of dirigible balloon, or aeroplane&mdash;some
kind of air machine. I’m not very
well up on them, so I can’t describe it to you. I
believe he is going to enter it at the Danforth
meet. I’m sorry, but you’re just too late to catch
him.”</p>

<p>“So are we,” agreed Ned sorrowfully. He
knew his father would be much disappointed, but
there was no help for it. Despondently the merchant’s
son turned and followed the professor out
of the hotel. Jerry and Bob sat in the auto waiting
for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what luck?” asked the tall lad, as his
chum approached.</p>

<p>“He’s just left,” answered Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Gone ballooning,” added Ned. “Out to the
Danforth meet and that’s just outside of New
York. We’ll never catch him, now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will!” cried Jerry suddenly.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“In our motor-ship <i>Comet</i>!” exclaimed the tall
lad. “We’ll fix that up, and get right on the trail
of Mr. Jackson again. Come on, Ned. Back
tracks for Cresville, and then for another voyage
through the air!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>GETTING EVEN</small></h2>


<p>Little time was lost starting back for Cresville.
The boys hoped to be at home that night,
and planned to at once start at work remodelling
their airship.</p>

<p>“And then we’ll go to Danforth,” decided
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Maybe we won’t be in time,” objected Ned.
“I don’t want to miss Mr. Jackson again, if I
can help it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that balloon and aeroplane meet will last
for some time,” explained the tall lad. “Mr.
Jackson is sure to be around there. We’ll land
him this time. It won’t take long to fix up the
<i>Comet</i>, if we all get to work on it.”</p>

<p>“It will seem good again to go scooting through
the air,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes; no danger of killing diseased calves up
above the clouds,” agreed Jerry, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll see anything of Mr. Sackett
on our way back?” said Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hope not,” was Bob’s comment, “though we
will pass through Tewkesbury Township. I’ve
seen all I want to of that swindler.”</p>

<p>They stopped for dinner that day in the same
hotel where the deputy cattle inspector had told
them of the trick Mr. Sackett had worked on
them, and, among the guests at the dinner table
was the same deputy himself.</p>

<p>“There’s Mr. Rider,” announced Jerry in a
low tone to his two chums, as the waitress helped
them to some fried chicken. The inspector caught
his name, looked up, and saw the boys.</p>

<p>“Well, if there ain’t the young fellows who go
around buying condemned calves!” he exclaimed,
getting up from the table to shake hands with
them and the professor. “I’m real glad to see
you again,” announced Mr. Rider, and he
changed his plate over to their table, where he
talked interestingly on many subjects.</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of Mr. Sackett
lately?” asked Jerry with a smile, as they finished
dinner and sat in the hotel parlor for a rest before
starting on again.</p>

<p>“No, but I expect to soon. I’ve got to go out
that way. The county board of health has another
case against him, and I expect to be sent on
it within a day or two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s it about&mdash;some more condemned
calves?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, it’s chickens this time. He’s got a big
flock of what he claims are pure-blooded buff
Cochins, but they’re not. They’re a hybrid
strain, and what’s more they have an incurable
disease. The trouble with Sackett is that he
doesn’t feed his stock right, nor take any care of
it. That’s why it’s nearly all diseased.</p>

<p>“These chickens are particularly bad. They’re
nice-looking fowls, but as soon as they get to a
certain age they die off. There are a lot of
chicken-raisers around Sackett’s place, and they’re
afraid their flocks will catch the ailment. So I’ve
been ordered to tell him to get rid of all his fowls,
disinfect his coops, and start all over. I know
he’ll kick like a steer, he’s so miserly, but he’ll
have to do it.”</p>

<p>“Has he got many chickens?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“About two hundred, and he values them pretty
highly, but they’re not worth a dollar. If any
one bought them they’d be stuck, for the fowls
would die inside of a month.”</p>

<p>The deputy inspector told the boys several
stories about Mr. Sackett, and also regaled
them with the news of the vicinity. Then, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
did not want to spend another night away from
home, they said good-by and departed.</p>

<p>Jerry was driving the car, and they were going
along at a good clip, when there came a sudden
snap, and something seemed to be wrong. The
tall lad brought the machine up with a jerk,
jumped out, and made a hasty examination.</p>

<p>“One of the small springs broken!” he announced
ruefully.</p>

<p>“Can’t it be fixed? Will we have to get out
and walk?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It could be repaired if we were near a blacksmith
shop,” answered Jerry. “It isn’t a bad
break, and I can still go on, but not very fast, and
it may get worse, if it isn’t repaired.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any blacksmith shop around here,”
observed Bob. “In fact, it wasn’t far from here
that we killed the calf, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it!” begged Jerry. “Well, I
guess I’ll take a chance, and go on slowly. We
may come to a garage within a few miles, though
I don’t remember seeing any on our other trip.”</p>

<p>As they were about to proceed, they saw a
farmer driving toward them. He halted to learn
the trouble, and to the delight of the boys announced
that there was a smithy about a mile
farther on, down a side road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The blacksmith shop was soon reached, and
while the proprietor was making the necessary repairs
Jerry and his chums sat outside where a
number of men were gathered, listening to their
talk. Mr. Snodgrass, as has probably been
guessed, was looking for bugs.</p>

<p>Quite a political discussion was under way
among the loungers about the smithy, when Ned,
looking down the village street, saw a figure approaching.
There was something vaguely familiar
about it. The merchant’s son nudged
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that our friend Mr. Sackett, of Tewkesbury
Township?” he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed the tall lad after a moment’s
inspection.</p>

<p>“He’s coming here.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Shall we tackle him about that calf?”</p>

<p>“By jinks! I’ve a good notion to. Wait until
he gets here, and we’ll see if he knows us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sackett came on with a shuffling gait. He
did not seem to observe the three boys, and they
were thinking in what manner they could get even
with the miser for the mean trick he had played
on them, when the grizzled old farmer, addressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
one of the men outside the blacksmith shop,
said:</p>

<p>“Well, Jason Stearn, have ye made up yer mind
t’ take my flock of buff Cochins? I’ve got t’
know right away, fer I’ve got another offer fer
’em, an’ I can’t wait on ye any longer. There’s
two hundred of th’ finest hens in Tewkesbury
Township, an’ I’m lettin’ ye have ’em at a bargain.”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums were all attention at this,
and as the miserly farmer had not yet noticed
them, Jerry pulled Ned and Bob out of sight behind
a wagon, slipping along with them himself.
From this vantage point they listened.</p>

<p>“Do ye want ’em, Jason?” went on Mr. Sackett.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’ve been thinkin’ of it, Eb,” drawled
the man addressed. “I want t’ git some nice hens,
an’ I like th’ Cochins as well as any. What’s yer
lowest figger?”</p>

<p>“One hundred an’ fifty dollars, jest as I told ye
afore. They’re wuth two hundred ef they’re
wuth a cent&mdash;an’ that’s only a dollar apiece&mdash;cheap
fer buff Cochins. Ye’ll have t’ speak
mighty soon, ef ye want ’em. I come down this
way special t’ see ye.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give ye a hundred an’ forty, Eb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, I’ll take ye!” exclaimed the miserly
farmer quickly. “Cash down, mind ye.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m willin’ t’ pay cash,” agreed Mr.
Stearn.</p>

<p>“An’ ye’ll have t’ pay suthin’ now, t’ bind the
bargain,” went on Mr. Sackett eagerly. “Newt
Porter an’ Si Granberry will be witnesses that ye
agreed t’ take ’em.”</p>

<p>“All right, Eb. Here’s ten dollars. I’ll pay
ye th’ rest when I come fer th’ fowls.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stearn was about to pass over a ten-dollar
bill to Mr. Sackett when Jerry, with a nudge to his
companions, stepped from behind the wagon, and
confronted the miser.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, Mr. Stearn,” said the tall
lad calmly. “I wouldn’t buy those chickens, if I
were you.”</p>

<p>“Not buy those chickens? Why not?” asked
the prospective purchaser. “They’re a good
flock, ain’t they?”</p>

<p>“No, they’re not,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“They’re diseased and will die inside of a
month,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Say, consarn ye! Who be you fellers, anyhow,
puttin’ in yer oars where ye ain’t wanted, an’
tryin’ t’ spoil a man’s trade?” demanded Mr.
Sackett with a snarl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you know who we are well
enough,” spoke Jerry calmly, as he stepped into
plainer view. “We bought a calf of you at rather
a high price the other day, Mr. Sackett, and afterward
learned that you were ordered to kill it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, them’s th’ fellers, eh?” remarked Mr.
Stearn, while as for the miserly farmer, he started
back in alarm at the sight of our heroes.</p>

<p>“What’s that calf got t’ do with my chickens?”
he demanded roughly.</p>

<p>“A great deal,” went on Jerry still calmly.
“Those fowls are diseased, just as the calf was,
and you know that your chickens have been condemned,
Mr. Sackett. You’ve been ordered by
the health department to get rid of them, and this
is the means you take&mdash;trying to sell them to
some one who will lose them all within a month.</p>

<p>“Don’t buy those chickens, Mr. Stearn,” went
on Jerry eagerly. “We met Mr. Rider, the
health inspector, a little while ago, and he told us
the whole story. It was he who told us about
the condemned calf we accidentally killed. Mr.
Rider will be here in a few days to see that the
flock of Cochins are disposed of, and if you don’t
want to throw your money away, don’t buy
them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s not so!” cried Mr. Sackett. “You’re
tryin’ t’ make trouble fer me!”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> true,” declared Jerry quietly. “My two
friends here heard the story, and so did Professor
Snodgrass. I’ll call the professor,” which he
did, from down the road where the scientist was
looking for strange insects.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly true,” declared Mr. Snodgrass,
“and I’m glad we are in time to prevent you from
cheating some one else, Mr. Sackett. If you sell
those diseased chickens it will be a swindle.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, they ain’t all sick,” asserted the farmer
lamely, “an’ I’m willin’ t’ make a reduction, ef
you’ll take ’em, Jason. I tell ye they’re fine
fowl!”</p>

<p>This was practically an admission that the
story of our heroes was true, and Mr. Stearn felt
it to be so. He put his money back into his
pocket.</p>

<p>“I guess we can’t do no business, Eb,” he remarked
dryly. “I’m much obliged to you young
fellers fer warnin’ me in time. I’d a-been badly
stuck, with a lot of diseased hens on my hands.
What do you mean by tryin’ such a trick, Eb
Sackett?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I didn’t know th’ hens was as bad as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that,” was the evasive answer. “I ain’t had no
official notice t’ that effect.”</p>

<p>“You knew it well enough, though,” declared
Jerry decisively.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, consarn ye, what right have ye got t’
be mindin’ my business an’ that of Jason Stearn
fer, I’d like to know?” demanded the angry miser,
seeing his plans foiled.</p>

<p>“We’ve got every honest right,” answered
Ned.</p>

<p>“Besides, you made us pay for a calf that was
no good,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh! I wish I had holt of ye out at my place
fer about five minutes!” muttered the angry man,
as he shook his fist at the boys, and turned away,
followed by the laughter of the loungers, who
were glad to see this turn to events. “I’d make
ye smart fer this,” declared Mr. Sackett, as he
went back the way he had come. “Spoilin’ a
man’s business this way. Them chickens is good
enough fer anybody!”</p>

<p>“Then you keep ’em,” answered Mr. Stearn,
as he again thanked the boys for the service they
had done him.</p>

<p>“I rather guess this makes us about even on the
calf deal,” observed Jerry grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Later they learned that Mr. Sackett tried elsewhere,
but unsuccessfully, to dispose of his fowls,
and finally they all died on his hands, after he
had spent considerable for medicine to cure them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>REBUILDING THE COMET</small></h2>


<p>“Where’s that monkey wrench?”</p>

<p>“Say, has anybody seen my ruler?”</p>

<p>“Hand over that hammer, will you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Look out there, Jerry, or that piece of scantling
will be down on your head!”</p>

<p>“Give me a hand here, somebody, I can’t shift
this exhaust pipe all alone.”</p>

<p>“Hey! Don’t put your foot through those hydroplanes,
Ned. Do you want to break ’em?”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the expressions, commands,
entreaties and warnings that could be
heard coming from the big barn, back of the
home of Jerry Hopkins, where, a few days after
the arrival of our heroes from their trip to Durham,
they began work at rebuilding the <i>Comet</i>.
They had decided on making several minor
changes to their motor-ship, in addition to equipping
it for work on the water, and they found the
task a little harder than anticipated.</p>

<p>But they succeeded in getting the help of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Glassford, who had originally planned the <i>Comet</i>,
and such assistance did he give, together with that
of some trained mechanics whom he hired, that it
seemed possible to make at least a trial trip in
about another week.</p>

<p>“And then we’ll sail for the balloon and aeroplane
meet at Danforth,” remarked Jerry, pausing
in the work of building the hydroplanes, for
that was his special feature, and he wanted to
have them just right.</p>

<p>“I only hope Mr. Jackson stays there until we
arrive,” spoke Ned. “He’s so queer that he may
leave at any time, and then we’ll have another
chase after him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll stay until the races start at least, I
think, fellows,” said Bob. “You know the secretary
of the meet wrote us that Mr. Jackson was
going to try for a prize in his new dirigible balloon,
and he won’t go away without making a
flight. The meet is delayed in opening, you know,
and I think we have plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“If we hadn’t, I wouldn’t have proposed going
this way,” came from Jerry. “We could go out
in a train or by auto, and get to him more quickly
than by delaying to rebuild our airship. But I
thought, as long as we did have the time we might
just as well make an air trip.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Ned. “Besides I think if we
arrive at the meet in the <i>Comet</i> it will create
something of a sensation, and if Mr. Jackson is
there he’ll be more apt to think we are ‘some
pumpkins’ than if we arrived by train or auto.”</p>

<p>“Was your father much disappointed that we
didn’t land him in Durham, and get him to sign
the papers?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“He sure was, Chunky,” replied the merchant’s
son. “But he knew it wasn’t our fault. He has
great hopes from our trip to Danforth, however.”</p>

<p>“Any let-up in his business troubles?” inquired
Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, they’re worse, if anything. Dad’s enemies
are pressing him hard, but he thinks he can
stand them off until we get to Mr. Jackson, and
enlist his aid. It’s going to be quite a task,
though. Poor dad! I wish I could help him!”</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> helping him!” insisted the fat youth,
as he stopped to rest after carrying a brace across
the barn to where it was to be fitted into the airship.
“You are doing all you can, and we’re helping
you.”</p>

<p>“I realize that, and I can’t thank you fellows
enough,” spoke Ned feelingly, for his father’s
troubles had made quite an impression on the lad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
as, indeed, they also had on his chums, and they
were all anxious to see them over. In fact, if they
were not speedily remedied it meant the loss of
Mr. Slade’s fortune, which he had made by a lifetime
of hard work.</p>

<p>So they were anxious to have the <i>Comet</i> refitted,
and start off on their trip to a point near
New York in order to meet Mr. Jackson. They
had learned by telegraph that the eccentric promoter
and millionaire was expected to arrive
any day, and would take part in the meet. Efforts
to intercept him en route, and get in communication
with him, had been futile, and they
were forced to wait. Mr. Slade grew more and
more anxious as the days passed, but he could only
fight off his business and financial enemies as best
he might.</p>

<p>They were busy days for the motor boys.
Early and late they worked on the <i>Comet</i>. The
main cabin was enlarged and improved. The engine
and machinery was overhauled, and made
more powerful. The gas-generating machine,
which supplied the lifting vapor, that was used
when it was not desired to operate the <i>Comet</i> as
an aeroplane, was changed to allow a more powerful
gas to be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Additional room for carrying provisions and
stores was provided, and a number of comforts
were added to the motor-ship’s equipment.</p>

<p>But the hydroplane attachments were the most
radical. As has been explained they enabled the
airship to alight on water and float there, and
Jerry even added an auxiliary propeller so that
the motor-ship could travel in the water for a
short distance.</p>

<p>So that, in reality, the <i>Comet</i> would soon be a
craft that could roll along the ground, on the
bicycle or starting wheels; it could sail through
the air, or skim on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows,” remarked Jerry one afternoon,
when all, including Mr. Glassford and his
helpers, had put in a hard day’s work on the craft,
“I think we’ll have her in shape in another day.
Then we can give her a try-out.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Mr. Glassford. “You ought
to test her on some water, for you are sure
enough that the air features are all right. It’s the
hydroplanes that need testing.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” admitted Jerry, “and I thought
of making a trip through the air to Lake Hammond,
and dropping down on the surface there.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>They were about to stop, assuring themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
by an inspection of the craft that at least one day
more would put her in shape for a trial in the air
and on water, when into the barn, that was used
as a work-shop, there burst a small chap, with
every appearance of great excitement oozing out
from almost every pore in his body.</p>

<p>“Jerry! Ned! Bob!” he gasped. “Come quick&mdash;he’s
out there&mdash;stuck fast&mdash;can’t get loose&mdash;squirming
around&mdash;down in a hole&mdash;sea-serpent
I guess&mdash;almost dead&mdash;Oh, it’s awful&mdash;poor man&mdash;get
a doctor&mdash;send for an ambulance&mdash;have a
trained nurse&mdash;come on, everybody! Don’t wait
a minute! He’ll disappear under ground! Come
quick! Hurry! Run! Run! Come on!”</p>

<p>“Well, for the love of cats, Andy Rush, what in
the name of the sacred cow is the matter now?”
cried Jerry, as he surveyed the excitable lad who
had burst in on them.</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on, quick!” was all the reply
Andy made and he turned and hastened from
the barn, followed by Ned, Bob and the others.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>ON THE WATER</small></h2>


<p>Hastening as rapidly as they could after the
excitable lad, our three heroes, with Mr. Glassford
and his men turned the corner of the barn,
and were soon in the fields back of Jerry’s house.</p>

<p>“Where are you taking us, Andy?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, what’s the trouble, anyhow?” demanded
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Let&mdash;up&mdash;I’m&mdash;winded!” panted the fat
Bob.</p>

<p>“Come on&mdash;he’s right near, now&mdash;Oh, I hope
we’re in time&mdash;run!”</p>

<p>That was all the answer Andy Rush gave, but
it was sufficient, for a few seconds later they came
in sight of the cause of his excitement.</p>

<p>A man was lying prone on the grass of the
meadow near the edge of a small brook. He was
stretched out at full length and one arm and hand
seemed to be in a deep hole.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Professor Snodgrass!” exclaimed
Ned, as he recognized the scientist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“I told you&mdash;that’s him&mdash;caught in a hole&mdash;help
him out&mdash;send for a doctor!” spluttered
Andy, dancing around first on one leg and then
on the other.</p>

<p>“Be quiet; can’t you?” pleaded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Sure I can. But I saw him&mdash;I ran for help&mdash;I
knew something was the matter&mdash;he called to
me as I was passing through the field&mdash;he’s going
to die, I guess!”</p>

<p>“Oh, guess again!” cried Ned, for Andy’s excitable
nature was getting on the nerves of them
all.</p>

<p>Jerry ran to where Professor Snodgrass was
lying face down in the grass. There was a look
of mild wonder on the countenance of the scientist.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the tall lad.
“Are you sick, Mr. Snodgrass?”</p>

<p>“Sick? No, Jerry. But I’m in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Trouble? What is it?” asked Mr. Glassford
solicitously. “Can we help you? You seem to be
caught in the hole.”</p>

<p>“No, I have caught something in the hole, to
be more correct,” spoke the professor calmly.
“Only he won’t let go, and I can’t pull him out,
or get my hand loose.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“A large mud turtle of a very rare variety,”
was the reply. “I was walking along, looking
for specimens, and I saw this one crawling on the
bank of the brook. I made a grab for him, just
as he was sliding into a muskrat’s hole, and got
him by the tail. However, he managed to get
into the opening a little way, and as my hand
kept slipping from his tail, I had to reach farther
and farther in, until my whole arm, up to the
shoulder, is down the hole, as you can see.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you pull your arm up?”
asked one of Mr. Glassford’s helpers.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” replied the professor simply. “You
see the turtle has hold of my hand, and won’t let
go.”</p>

<p>“How can he have hold of your hand, when
you have him by the tail?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t got hold of his tail <em>now</em>,” explained
Mr. Snodgrass, as if it was the most simple
thing in the world. “You see after he got
down the hole he pulled loose his tail from my
grasp, turned around, and before I knew it he
had my hand in his mouth. That’s why I can’t
pull my arm up. I have to lie here. In fact, I’ve
been here some time, and when I saw this young
man passing by I asked him to go for help,” and
the professor indicated Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I went&mdash;I ran&mdash;I jumped!” exclaimed
the small chap. “I told the news&mdash;I brought help&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Andy,” said Ned gently, and the
excitable lad subsided.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon help you!” said Mr. Glassford to
the scientist. “Here,” he called to his two assistants.
“Get some sticks, dig down through the
earth to where the turtle has hold of this gentleman,
and kill it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Don’t, I beg of you! Not for
worlds! Don’t kill it!” cried the professor. “It
is a very valuable specimen, and I may never be
able to get another like it.”</p>

<p>“But it is biting your hand!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“You may get blood poison,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have a heavy glove on,” explained the
scientist, “and he can’t hurt me. But I wish you
would dig him out, and then I could get him.
But don’t hurt him. He’ll hold on until then, I
guess, and really I don’t mind it a bit.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll get tired lying there,” objected
Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” declared the professor simply. “I
would be willing to lie here all night this way,
for the sake of getting such a fine specimen.”</p>

<p>There was no getting him to change his mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
or slip off his glove, and let the turtle go. So
shovels were sent for, and, after some work, the
hole was made larger, until the professor was able
to put in his other arm and pull out the turtle.</p>

<p>“Oh, you little beauty!” he exclaimed, as he
held up the wiggling reptile. “You are indeed
valuable! Why that specimen is worth at least
fifty dollars!” he said.</p>

<p>“I know a pond full of ’em, and I’ll give you
all you want for a quarter,” said one of Mr.
Glassford’s men.</p>

<p>“Not this kind,” asserted the professor
proudly, as he bore off his prize.</p>

<p>“Will you give me a ride in the airship, for
bringing you news of the professor?” asked Andy,
as he walked back with the boys. He had calmed
down somewhat.</p>

<p>“Sure we will,” agreed Jerry. “You can come
on the trial trip we’re going to take to-morrow or
next day&mdash;if you promise not to yell in case we
fall.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;I promise,” said Andy, after thinking
it over.</p>

<p>Uriah Snodgrass, who was stopping at Jerry’s
house pending the start for Danforth, suffered
no ill effects from his experience with the turtle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and the next day was hunting new specimens with
as much energy as before. He was anxious to
get started on his quest for the singing fish, but, in
the meanwhile, occupied himself as best he could.</p>

<p>It was found impossible to get the <i>Comet</i> in
readiness for a trial the next day, but on the following
one, when the last adjustments had been
made to the machinery, Jerry decided that it
would be safe to risk a flight. Mr. Glassford and
his men had completed their work, and departed,
and our three heroes, together with Andy Rush
and Professor Snodgrass, made up the party that
entered the cabin of the motor-ship after it was
wheeled out of the barn.</p>

<p>The hydroplanes which were on toggle-joint
arms had been lifted up off the ground, and could
be let down when it was desired to float on water.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll go up by means of the gas bag,
and not use the aeroplane wings now,” decided
Jerry. “We haven’t room enough to get a good
start, now that the <i>Comet</i> is larger than she was
formerly.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the vapor machine was set in operation,
and soon a hissing announced that the gas
was entering the big bag that formed the superstructure
of the <i>Comet</i>. Some of the boys’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
friends had gathered to see them off, and Mr.
Slade was present, for he was vitally interested in
the success of the remodelled motor-ship.</p>

<p>“How’s the pressure?” called Jerry to Ned,
who was in the engine room, while the tall lad
took his place in the steering house.</p>

<p>“About five hundred pounds,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“That’s enough. We’re ready to go up.
Andy, you help Bob cast off the anchor ropes.
Professor&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no use asking him to do anything,”
spoke Bob in a low voice to his chum. “He’s just
seen a new kind of a bug crawling around on
deck, and he’s after it on his hands and knees.”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess we won’t disturb him then,”
decided the tall lad. “We can manage. Get
ready to cast off, Chunky.”</p>

<p>A little more gas was allowed to go into the
bag. The motor-ship was pulling and tugging at
the anchor ropes, as if eager to be free to rise in
the air.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” suddenly called Jerry.</p>

<p>Bob and Andy released the ropes, and the
<i>Comet</i> shot up with the swiftness of a rocket.</p>

<p>“Say, she’s got more speed than she used to
have,” exclaimed Ned from the engine-room, as
he adjusted levers and gear wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought the new gas machine would do the
trick,” said Jerry rather proudly.</p>

<p>He started the big propellers, and soon the
motor-ship, instead of shooting straight up, like a
balloon, darted forward, like an aeroplane.
Faster and faster she went, until the cheers of the
little crowd below could be no longer heard.</p>

<p>“Where are you heading?” asked Bob, as, followed
by Andy Rush, he entered the steering
house, where Jerry was busy with various levers,
handles and valve wheels.</p>

<p>“Straight for Lake Hammond,” was the answer.
“We’ll be there in half an hour, and then
we can see how the hydroplanes work.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was not pushed to her full speed, as
some of the machinery was new, and the boys
wanted to see how it would work. They found
that it was doing satisfactorily, however, and the
various new appliances they had added were very
successful.</p>

<p>They were flying along at a moderate height,
looking for a sight of Lake Hammond, a large
body of water about twenty miles from Cresville.
Bob, Ned and Jerry found plenty to do, but Andy
Rush was as good as his name, rushing here and
there, exclaiming in delight at the scenery that
seemed to be slipping along beneath him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s great&mdash;marvellous&mdash;wonderful!” he exploded.</p>

<p>“Remember what I told you,” cautioned Jerry.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“You’re not to yell if we fall.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;I won’t.”</p>

<p>The speed of the motor-ship was now increased,
and she was skimming along through the
air, almost up to the limit of her previous record
before the changes were made. Jerry knew, however,
that she could go much faster when urged.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Andy, who was looking from
one of the forward windows, cried out:</p>

<p>“I see the lake! There she is!”</p>

<p>Jerry, who had set the automatic steering apparatus,
and who had left the wheel, hastened
forward.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s Lake Hammond,” he agreed.</p>

<p>“We’ll be floating on the surface in a few minutes
if all goes well. Slow down, Ned.”</p>

<p>They were all soon busy over the machinery,
and when the craft had been brought to slower
speed they glanced down, and saw the shining
waters of the lake below them. Several rowboats
and motor craft were on it, and in the distance
was a yacht.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you all ready for the trial?” called Jerry,
with his hand on the lever that would let out the
gas, and cause a descent.</p>

<p>“All ready,” answered Ned, and his voice was
a trifle solemn. Suppose the hydroplanes should
not work?</p>

<p>“Here we go then!” announced the tall lad.
He yanked the lever toward him. There was a
hissing sound, and the <i>Comet</i>, whose propellers
had ceased revolving, shot downward.</p>

<p>With a quick motion Jerry straightened out
the toggle-jointed arms that held the hydroplanes.
They slipped into place, as the bicycle wheels
moved out of the way.</p>

<p>A few seconds later the <i>Comet</i>, with a little
splash, had settled down upon the surface of the
lake as gracefully as a wild swan, and floated
as gently and as lightly as a cork.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Jerry. “She floats! She
floats!”</p>

<p>“Will she move?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” and Jerry started the water
propeller.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, and then gathering speed, the
motor-ship adapted herself to the watery element
as well as she had to the earth or air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Success! Success!” murmured Ned, while
from the motor-boats on the lake came shrill whistles
of greeting to the new and strange craft that
had so unexpectedly appeared among them.</p>

<small>IN PERIL</small></h2>


<p>“Say, isn’t this great?” demanded Jerry of his
companions, as he stood in the steering house, and
directed the course of the <i>Comet</i> on the lake. “I
guess now you agree with me, don’t you, Bob,
that the hydroplanes are all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are,” admitted the stout lad. “I
didn’t think they’d work so well.”</p>

<p>“Me, either,” spoke Ned. “They’ll be all right
in case we have to go over some part of the ocean,
or a large body of water, and something happens
so that we have to descend.”</p>

<p>“I hope we <em>will</em> very soon be over the ocean,”
remarked Mr. Snodgrass earnestly, as he came
forward, holding in his hand a little bug, of which
he seemed to take great care. He had been so
interested in its capture that he had taken little
notice of the landing on the lake.</p>

<p>“We’ll try a flight over the water, perhaps a
trip out to sea for a few miles, and back again,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
said Jerry. “Now that it works all right, I’m
not afraid to go anywhere in the <i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>“But first we go to Danforth,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Of course, to see Mr. Jackson. There’s no
reason why we can’t start to-morrow or the next
day,” said the tall lad.</p>

<p>“We can’t get the grub and other things on
board in that time,” objected Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, we can, if we leave the eating part to
you,” declared Ned. “You’ll see that there’s
plenty of canned chicken and stuff like that, and
Jerry and I can hustle in the stores, gasolene and
supplies. Maybe we could start to-morrow, fellows.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my share,” agreed the fat lad.</p>

<p>“It’s rather too short notice,” objected Jerry.
“But we can start in two or three days. I’ll have
to make a few little changes in the machinery,
and we’ll be all right then.”</p>

<p>“All I care about is getting the singing fish,”
spoke Professor Snodgrass, scanning the surface
of the lake as if he might sight a specimen there.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was moving slowly over the water.
It was not built for very great speed in that
element, being designed for use in the air, but it
made fairly good progress. By using the air propellers
it could be made to go much faster, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they would be put into operation when it was designed
to get a flying start so that the wing planes
would lift the craft up.</p>

<p>But now only the water propeller was being
used, and as the <i>Comet</i> glided along she was soon
surrounded by many other craft, the occupants of
which wanted to know what kind of a boat the
boys had.</p>

<p>Their curiosity was satisfied in a measure, and
one enthusiastic motor-boat owner wanted to race.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’re not in your class,” objected
Jerry. “If you wait a few minutes, though, we’ll
make an ascension, and then we’ll accept the challenge.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid <em>I</em> wouldn’t be in it then,” answered
the motor-boat man with a laugh. “But
you sure have a great craft there.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try the air propellers now,” went on
Jerry, “and see if we can get up speed enough to
rise into the air without using the gas bag.
That’s a point of which I am still in doubt.”</p>

<p>“Supposing we don’t rise?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, then we can force gas into the bag.
But I’d like to try the wings now, and see how
they work since we changed the shape and the
angle of inclination.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” called Ned, and he and Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
helped Jerry to get the machinery ready for the
new test. The water propeller was stopped, and
soon the air ones were whirring around like blurs
of light.</p>

<p>“Clear the way!” yelled Jerry to a little flotilla
of rowing and motor craft that were in the path
he proposed to take in skimming over the surface
of the water. “Clear the way, or we may run you
down!”</p>

<p>The boats made haste to pull to one side or the
other, leaving a lane along which the <i>Comet</i> could
dash before mounting up into the air.</p>

<p>Faster and faster went the propellers. The
motor-ship gathered way. It was sliding over the
surface now on the hydroplanes, which were like
little boats, or the runners of an ice yacht. More
and more speed did the <i>Comet</i> develop.</p>

<p>“I guess she’ll do it,” murmured Jerry. “I’ll
tilt the elevation rudder in a few seconds and then&mdash;well,
we’ll see what will happen.”</p>

<p>He looked ahead over the water course. The
craft was making considerable progress then, in a
straight line. Jerry reached for the lever that
controlled the rudder which would send them
aloft. He glanced at the speed register and noted
that they had not yet reached sufficient momentum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, from the lee of a large sailing yacht
that had come to anchor out of the path of the
<i>Comet</i> to watch the test, there shot a rowboat containing
a girl and a lady. Right in the path of the
oncoming motor-ship was the small boat.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Jerry through a megaphone.</p>

<p>“Pull to one side,” added Ned, though they
could not hear his voice above the noise of the engine.</p>

<p>“Row out! Row to one side!” cried Jerry
again. “We’ll run you down! We can’t steer to
the right or left without capsizing!”</p>

<p>This was true, for to swerve the motor-ship
off a straight course at the speed at which she was
going would have meant disaster.</p>

<p>“Look out! Look out!” yelled Jerry desperately,
waving his arms in warning. The sailors
on the yacht now added their voices to those
aboard the <i>Comet</i>, and the woman and girl became
confused. Each one had an oar, and they
were not pulling together.</p>

<p>All at once the girl lost her blade overboard,
and the lady, pulling on hers, sent the rowboat
about in a circle. Around it spun, right in the
path of the oncoming <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Slow up! Go to the left&mdash;no the right&mdash;back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
up&mdash;we’ll be killed&mdash;they’ll be killed&mdash;jump over
them&mdash;up in the air&mdash;do something!” yelled
Andy Rush.</p>

<p>“Quiet!” shouted Jerry. He saw that it would
be useless to call further to the occupants of the
rowboat. They were helpless. Nor did it seem
possible to stop the <i>Comet</i> in time, though Jerry
had his hand on the reverse lever. Even at slackened
speed, if they hit the small boat, they would
upset it, either killing the occupants or throwing
them into the water. And there was grave danger
to the comparatively frail <i>Comet</i>, in the
event of a collision.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>OFF TO THE MEET</small></h2>


<p>Jerry Hopkins made up his mind that there
was but one thing to do. It was utterly out of
the question to stop in time now, or to swerve
from the direct path, in which was the small boat.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to jump over them!” murmured
the tall lad to himself. “We’ve hardly speed
enough to rise, yet I’ve got to chance it. If I
don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He dared not think of the alternative. With a
quick motion he threw the lever of the motor
over as far as it would go. It meant full speed
ahead, and with a rush and a roar, a rumbling
and trembling, the powerful machine took up the
extra fuel that was thrown into it.</p>

<p>“It’s now or never!” murmured the steersman,
while the occupants of the motor-ship gazed
ahead with fear-filled eyes. In the small boat
crouched the woman and girl, while on board the
sailing yacht a man was vainly reaching out with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a landing hook, endeavoring to pull the little craft
out of danger.</p>

<p>“Now!” suddenly shouted Jerry as if he was
calling to some one, and he yanked the elevation
rudder lever toward him.</p>

<p>Like a thing alive the <i>Comet</i> seemed to lift herself
from the surface of the water. The front end
was elevated, the forward hydroplanes emerging
dripping from the liquid element. Now they
were almost over the rowboat, in the bottom of
which, clinging to each other in terror, were the
two trembling occupants.</p>

<p>Would the rear end of the airship&mdash;the big
after-hydroplanes clear them; or would they dash
them to death?</p>

<p>This was the question that every one on board
the <i>Comet</i> was asking himself, Jerry most anxiously
of all, for it was his desperate plan that
was being tried. Yet there was no other way.</p>

<p>With a whizzing and a rushing sound the
motor-ship lifted herself from the lake. Upward
and upward she mounted, the rear hydroplanes
being now clear of the water. In another moment
the airship passed over the heads of those
in the rowboat, clearing them by about five feet,
as Jerry and his chums learned afterward. They
could not see what took place below them and directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the rear, but when they were well up in
the air, by looking back, they could see the woman
and the girl in the boat, unharmed. There was a
prayer of thankfulness in every heart.</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Jerry, as he wiped the
perspiration from his forehead, and slowed down
the speed of the motor. “I wouldn’t go through
such an experience again for a million dollars.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” chimed in Ned. “I thought they
were goners, as well as ourselves.”</p>

<p>“It was a narrow squeak,” added Bob. “They
came out directly in our path.”</p>

<p>“Well, they didn’t mean to,” suggested the tall
lad. “I guess they were as badly frightened as
we were. But the <i>Comet</i> did herself proud on
this occasion.”</p>

<p>“And you handled your craft most excellently,”
complimented Professor Snodgrass, who, during
the recent excitement, had remained a mute spectator.
“I never saw better nerve displayed, Jerry,
my boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it was the only thing to do,” was
the modest answer. “I guess we’ll head for home
now, and get a nerve-bracer in the shape of some
ice-cream soda, or something like that; eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Bob and Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wow! Nothing like it&mdash;scoot along&mdash;over
the water&mdash;up in the air&mdash;jump over their heads&mdash;down
again&mdash;sail along&mdash;turn a somersault&mdash;rush
at ’em&mdash;scare ’em to death&mdash;whoop-de-doodle
do! Wow!” Andy Rush was fairly quivering
with poorly-repressed excitement.</p>

<p>They reached Cresville without further incident,
made a good landing, and received the congratulation
of many friends who gathered around
the barn on Jerry’s premises, as soon as it was
learned that the <i>Comet</i> had returned.</p>

<p>“Did it work all right?” Mr. Slade was anxious
to know.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better, dad,” replied his son.</p>

<p>“Then are you soon going&mdash;” The merchant
did not finish, but they knew what he meant.</p>

<p>Mr. Slade was exceedingly anxious to get into
communication with Mr. Jackson, and his son,
seeing a worried look on his parent’s face, asked:</p>

<p>“Are things any worse, dad?”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re no better,” was the reply, “and
I fear there is some new move afoot on the part
of those who are trying to ruin me. If I don’t get
help soon it will be too late.”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave for Danforth day after to-morrow,”
decided Jerry on hearing this.</p>

<p>“Can we be ready in time?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll have to,” was the grim retort. “I’ll let
you and Bob attend to the storing of the provisions
and supplies, and I’ll tinker with the machinery.
We can do it if we hustle, and hustle
we will. Meanwhile you might send a telegram
to the authorities of the meet, asking if Mr. Jackson
has arrived yet, and if he has, request them
to tell him to wait until we get there, as we have
an important message for him.”</p>

<p>Ned did this, and received a reply to the effect
that Mr. Jackson had not yet arrived. It was
stated, however, that his dirigible balloon was on
the ground, and that his employées were getting
it in shape for a flight on the opening day of the
aeroplane carnival, which was four days off.</p>

<p>“Oh, then we’ll be in plenty of time,” declared
Jerry. “There is always some delay in these affairs,
and, once we get started in the <i>Comet</i> we
can make all kinds of fast time. You needn’t
worry about it, Mr. Slade.”</p>

<p>But the merchant could not help worrying, for
his business affairs were in dire straits.</p>

<p>The adjusting of the machinery, and the fitting
out of the motor-ship for the coming voyage, proceeded
rapidly. Bob, to whom was left the purchasing
of the provisions, was in his element.</p>

<p>The last work had been done, the last box put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
aboard, and the final adjustment made to the
machinery. The <i>Comet</i> was ready to leave.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before a crowd of curiosity-seekers
had had time to gather, our heroes
and Professor Snodgrass entered the cabin. The
parents of the boys were there to say good-bye.</p>

<p>“All ready?” called Jerry to his chums.</p>

<p>“All ready,” came the answer.</p>

<p>There was a hissing sound as the gas rushed
into the big bag, a straining of the holding ropes,
and then, as they were cast off, the motor-ship rose
into the air. Jerry started the propellers.</p>

<p>“Off at last!” exclaimed Ned, waving his hand
to his father.</p>

<p>“And may we be successful!” murmured Jerry.</p>

<p>A small figure dashed up the street. Off came
a hat which was waved in the air. Then came a
shrill cheer.</p>

<p>“There they go! Off in the air&mdash;rush along&mdash;never
say die&mdash;blow up&mdash;no matter&mdash;on again&mdash;that’s
the stuff! Good luck! Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“No need to look to see who that is,” remarked
Jerry, as he put on a little more speed,
and the <i>Comet</i> pointed her sharp nose toward the
place of the balloon meet, where our friends
hoped to get the aid of the man who could save
Mr. Slade from ruin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>A PRECARIOUS POSITION</small></h2>


<p>Airship travel was scarcely a novelty to our
heroes now, but, like many other things, there was
always some new feature to it. Just as on an auto
trip you never can tell what is going to happen,
and just as two auto trips are never the same, so
with travel in a motor-ship.</p>

<p>“We may start off all right, and we may get
there all right,” said Jerry, “but you never can
tell what is going to happen in the meanwhile.”</p>

<p>The start of our friends was auspicious enough.
Rising high above the country surrounding their
home town, they soon found themselves in a favorable
current, and then, allowing some of the
gas to flow out of the bag, and into the compression
container, Jerry speeded up the propellers
so that the <i>Comet</i> was sailing along now as a regular
aeroplane, depending on her forward motion
and on the pressure of air on the surfaces of
the wing planes for support.</p>

<p>“We want to get used to travelling both ways,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
remarked Jerry to his chums, “for it will be wise
to save our gas for emergencies. Anyhow the
<i>Comet</i> is as good an aeroplane as she is a dirigible
balloon, and we can go faster in the former
shape, as there is not so much air resistance when
the gas bag is not fully inflated.”</p>

<p>There were many small tasks to do after they
had gotten well under way, and the better part
of the morning was taken up in performing them.
Jerry looked to the machinery, which, in spite of
several adjustments, needed some attention. Bob
saw to it that his provisions were all in place, and
Ned checked over his stores, to make sure he had
forgotten nothing.</p>

<p>As for Uriah Snodgrass, it mattered little to
him where he was, whether in the air, or on the
earth or water, save that in the air there were
not so many chances of gathering specimens.
However, when he could not capture bugs he
could look over those already in his specimen
boxes, arrange and classify them, and jot down
notes concerning them. It was this latter work
which now occupied him.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Snodgrass?” asked Ned when
Bob, after a time spent in the kitchen, announced
supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was in the main cabin a few minutes ago,
writing in his note-book,” said Jerry. “I saw
him as I passed through.”</p>

<p>A glance into the cabin showed that the professor
was not there.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s already eating, in the dining-room,”
remarked Bob. “He might have gotten
hungry, and couldn’t wait.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he’s not like you,” retorted Ned.
Still he looked into the cabin where the table was
set, but no scientist appeared. The motor room
was equally unproductive, and the boys now
looked anxiously at one another.</p>

<p>“Can he have fallen overboard?” asked Bob,
his voice trembling with apprehension.</p>

<p>“We’d have heard him cry if he fell,” said
Jerry. Still, he went to the rail and looked down.
They were passing over a broad stretch of
meadow land, and there was no evidence that
their friend had tumbled down.</p>

<p>“The storeroom,” suggested Ned. They hurried
there, but found no professor!</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob, who had gone out on the after
deck, uttered a cry of alarm. His companions
hastened toward him, and looked to where he
pointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>There, lying face downward on the projecting
stern of the motor-ship, his head and shoulders
out of sight, was the missing professor, in a most
precarious position!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>BOMBARDED WITH ROCKETS</small></h2>


<p>“Grab his legs!” cried Jerry. “I’ll take one,
and you the other, Ned! Bob, you stand by to
help! He’s almost overboard!”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better slow up the engine?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“No, we’ve only got headway enough on now
to keep us afloat! No time to slow up!”</p>

<p>“Then go down!” advised Bob. “He won’t
fall so far.”</p>

<p>“No, we’ve got to pull him back right away!”
declared the tall lad. “Come on now. He must
have fainted, and has very nearly fallen off.
Grab his legs! Quick!”</p>

<p>Cautiously the three lads advanced toward the
edge of the platform, over which the professor’s
head and shoulders were hanging.</p>

<p>Jerry made a grab for the left leg, Ned for the
right, while the stout lad stood ready to lend
whatever assistance might be needed.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had Ned and Jerry gotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a good hold, and were about to haul in, than the
professor, with a combination wiggle and squirm
turned over, hitched himself along the deck, sat
upright and yelled:</p>

<p>“I’ve got it! I’ve got it! Oh, you little
beauty! Oh, you prize! I thought you’d never
come near enough but you did, and now you’re
mine!”</p>

<p>Over his head he swung his large butterfly net,
with a long handle, and before the astonished
boys could ask what was the meaning of his conduct,
the scientist gathered into a small space in a
pocket in the bottom of the net, a tiny insect,
something like a dragon-fly. Then, having insured
the safety of his specimen, Mr. Snodgrass
looked calmly at the boys who stood regarding
him with amazement and fear mingled on their
faces.</p>

<p>“Well, I got it,” said the scientist coolly.</p>

<p>“Got what?” asked Jerry, a little provoked at
the scare they had received.</p>

<p>“This high-flying June bug. That’s not the
scientific name for it, but the Latin one is so long
you wouldn’t understand it. I’ve got him!” and
the professor eagerly peered at his prize.</p>

<p>“We thought we had lost you,” spoke Ned
significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lost me&mdash;how?”</p>

<p>“Why, when we saw you lying over the edge of
the deck we were afraid you had nearly fallen
overboard.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you had such a scare on my account,”
remarked the professor more soberly.
“You see I had no idea that I was causing you
worry. I was sitting on the back of the airship,
wishing I could catch some specimen, when I
heard a buzzing sound. I looked, and there, following
us was one of these rare insects.</p>

<p>“I at once got my longest-handled net, but when
I tried to catch the little beauty it dodged me.
Finally it went down just below us, and the only
way I could reach it was to lie on my face, reach
out and down as far as I could, and swoop for it.”</p>

<p>“A mighty risky thing to do,” commented
Jerry, for in some matters the professor was like
a child.</p>

<p>“I know it,” the scientist agreed cheerfully.
“Once I thought sure I was going to fall.”</p>

<p>“How did it make you feel?” asked Bob, curious
to know.</p>

<p>“Well, all I remember thinking is that the high-flying
June bug would get away, or that some
other scientist would capture him. Then I managed
to get it in my net, and just at that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
you boys came along, and grabbed me by the
legs.”</p>

<p>“Well, please don’t do it again,” begged Jerry,
trying not to smile.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised the professor.</p>

<p>“Supper’s getting cold,” observed Bob ruefully.
“Come on, I’m hungry!”</p>

<p>“Same old tune!” mocked Jerry, and there was
a laugh that somewhat relieved the strain under
which they were.</p>

<p>The professor did not seem to think he had
taken any unusual risk, and he was so overjoyed
at the capture of the rare insect, which was worth
at least seventy-five dollars, according to his estimate,
that the boys did not have the heart to
speak of the great fright he had caused them.</p>

<p>After supper, when several matters had been
looked to, the lamps were lighted, and the great
search-lantern gotten in readiness. Soon its powerful
glow was cutting the gathering darkness as
the big airship glided forward through space.</p>

<p>“Well, morning will see us within a few miles
of our destination,” remarked Jerry, as he and
his chums sat about the table in the main cabin.
“Then we can make a quick run out to the aviation
grounds, have a talk with Mr. Jackson, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
he’s there, and if not we’ll wait for him. Then,
after we’ve seen him, we’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Start for the ocean, I hope,” put in the professor,
who was busy jotting notes down in his
books. “I am very anxious to get after the singing
fish.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we’ll chance an ocean trip,”
agreed Jerry. “But I guess I’d better go now and
see how nearly we are keeping on our course,”
he added, for he had set the automatic steering
apparatus, and, as they were flying rather low, he
did not dare trust altogether to it, without an occasional
adjustment.</p>

<p>He found, however, that they were within a
point and a half of the way in which the nose
of the craft should have been pointed, and, after
correcting the error, which was caused by the lack
of smoothness of the new machinery, Jerry was
about to return to the cabin where the others
were.</p>

<p>As he turned to leave the motor room, he noted
that the height gauge indicated less than a quarter
of a mile.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty low,” mused the youth, “but I
guess we won’t hit anything. To get higher I’ve
got to increase the speed, and I don’t want to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that and strain the machinery. I guess this will
do. In the morning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jerry paused in the midst of his sentence.
From somewhere outside there came a rushing,
roaring sound, followed by a loud explosion.</p>

<p>“The gas bag!” was the first thought of the
tall lad. “It’s burst!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he heard Ned and Bob
crying from the cabin.</p>

<p>Jerry rushed out on deck, and, as he emerged
a glare of light caught his eye. A fear of fire entered
his mind, but, as he watched it, the glow
seemed to die away. Not before, however, Jerry
had noted that the gas bag, which was partly
inflated, was intact. Nothing had happened to it.</p>

<p>“What was that?” demanded Ned, emerging
from the main cabin, followed by Bob and the
professor.</p>

<p>“Just what I’m trying to discover,” replied the
widow’s son. “It sounded like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There it goes again!” yelled Bob, as, with a
whizz and a roar, a streak of fire passed by the
airship, and burst into balls of vari-colored light
just beyond the craft.</p>

<p>“Meteors!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>“Falling stars, perhaps,” agreed the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry looked down, over the edge of the rail.
Below him there was a great illumination.</p>

<p>“Look!” he cried to his companions. “We’re
over some city.”</p>

<p>“And they’re having a celebration,” added
Ned.</p>

<p>“And bombarding us with rockets,” came from
Bob. “Look out, here comes a sheaf of them,”
and, as he spoke, from somewhere down below
on the earth there shot upward a fiery volcano of
pyrotechnics, that seemed to be aimed directly at
the motor-ship.</p>

<p>“They <em>are</em> shooting at us!” cried Jerry.
“Quick! Out with the lights, or they’ll set us on
fire! Douse every glim!”</p>

<p>He rushed for the electric switches, followed
by his companions, while the <i>Comet</i> forged slowly
ahead through the rain of fire, the sparks from
the rockets shooting all about her.</p>

<small>AN ANGRY FARMER</small></h2>


<p>With a suddenness that was almost startling
the incandescent lights on the <i>Comet</i> went out.
The airship shot forward through the darkness
shrouded in gloom&mdash;no, not completely, for the
great search light still glowed, and that offered
a mark for the hissing rockets and aerial bombs.</p>

<p>“Quick! Out with the search lantern!” yelled
Jerry. “You put that out, Bob, while Ned and I
get to work on the engine and send the ship up.
Start the gas machine, Ned!”</p>

<p>“Will it be safe, with all this fire around us?
It might explode.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. We’ll have to depend on the
planes to take us higher. I’ll speed up the
motor!”</p>

<p>“But why in the world are they firing at us?”
cried Ned. “Hurry, Chunky, haven’t you got
that search light out yet? They can see to aim
at us as long as it’s going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t seem to shut it off!” cried the stout
youth. “The lever is jammed.”</p>

<p>“Give him a hand, Ned,” called the tall lad.
“I can manage the motor all right.”</p>

<p>“Look!” suddenly cried Ned, pointing to the
rear as he and his chum managed to put out the
light. “There is another airship following us!”</p>

<p>They all glanced to where he pointed. In the
darkness they could see a long, illuminated shape
whizzing swiftly through the air.</p>

<p>“It’s some sort of an aerial craft, all
right,” murmured Jerry. “I wonder if Noddy
Nixon&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“See! They’re firing rockets at <em>her</em> now,”
yelled Bob. “Say, the people down below must
have some big objection to airships. First they
fire at us, and then at the next aeroplane that
comes along.”</p>

<p>Jerry, who had set the motor at higher speed
to take them out of the zone of rockets, uttered
an exclamation.</p>

<p>“I have it!” he cried. “I see through it now.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“They took us for part of the illumination,”
went on the tall lad. “They fired at us to see if
they could hit us, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They’ve hit that other airship!” shouted Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
pointing to it. “See! They’ve set it on fire! Oh,
what an awful death those poor fellows aboard it
will have!”</p>

<p>“Let’s save them!” suggested the professor.</p>

<p>“There’s no one aboard her,” put in Jerry
more calmly than any of the others.</p>

<p>“No one aboard her? Do you mean she’s a
runaway airship?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t an airship at all. I’ll tell you,”
and Jerry went to the engine-room, where he
slowed down the motor, for the plan of putting
out the lights had been effective, and no more
rockets were shot at them.</p>

<p>“They took us for part of the celebration,”
went on Jerry when he returned. “They probably
arranged to have some sort of a miniature,
automatic airship sent up, aimed to go across the
place above where the fireworks were being set
off, but high in the air. Then it was the game to
try and hit it with rockets.”</p>

<p>This later was found to be the case.</p>

<p>“We came along, and they took us for the
miniature craft and fired at us,” Jerry continued.
“It was all a mistake, but it was lucky they didn’t
hit us. They must be puzzled, though, to see the
second airship coming along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, they’ve done for that one, anyhow!”
cried Bob. “See, it’s all afire!”</p>

<p>It was blazing fiercely, and beginning to descend,
while a shower of rockets, and aerial bombs
shot all around it. Our friends were now out of
reach of the pyrotechnics, and ventured to turn on
their lights again. Down below could be seen the
place of the celebration, brilliantly illuminated,
but the glow soon died out, and it was evident
that the destruction of the miniature airship
brought the affair to a close.</p>

<p>They did not get to sleep early, on account of
the excitement, but finally Jerry suggested that
they take turns going on duty in the motor room.</p>

<p>“For,” said the tall lad, “we’re flying low, and
the machinery is so new that we can’t altogether
depend on the automatic steering gear. So, to
avoid accidents, some one will have to be on
watch all night.”</p>

<p>Morning came, with nothing having happened,
and Bob was about early, bustling here and there
getting breakfast. They were eating it, taking occasional
glimpses down at the country over which
they were passing, and speculating on when they
would arrive at the balloon meet, and what would
happen when they got there, when, with a suddenness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
that was terrifying, the <i>Comet</i> was jerked
backward.</p>

<p>The big aircraft trembled from end to end,
and shivered throughout her length. Next followed
a series of jerks, and then came a ripping,
rending, tearing and splintering sound, hearing
which, Jerry, with fear on his face, leaped to his
feet.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Have we blown up?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“My specimens!” shouted the professor, making
a dive for his room, where he kept the boxes.</p>

<p>Jerry rushed out on deck, and looked down
over the rail. The airship was now stationary,
though the propellers were buzzing around, and
the tall lad soon saw the reason for the sudden
halt.</p>

<p>They were over a farmyard, and the anchor
rope, to which was attached a grapple, with several
prongs, had caught under the cornice of a
large barn, holding the <i>Comet</i> securely. And,
strewn on the earth, at one side of the structure,
were splintered boards and pieces of timber that
had been ripped off, as the dangling, sharp-pointed
anchor had caught in the eaves and tore
along, ripping off part of the roof. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
craft, as the anchor met a solid timber, had come
to a stop.</p>

<p>As Jerry looked down, there rushed out from
the farmhouse an angry farmer. In his hands he
held a gun, which he pointed at the airship.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye dare t’ move!” he yelled. “Don’t
ye stir! I’ve got th’ drop on ye, an’ I’m goin’ t’
keep it! <a href="#image03">Ye don’t stir a step till ye come down
an’ settle fer th’ damage.</a> Ye well-nigh ripped my
barn apart, an’ I jest had it fixed. Come down,
ye rapscallions! Don’t ye stir a step till ye pay
me!”</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_133">“YE DON’T STIR A STEP TILL YE COME DOWN AN’

</div>

<p>He shook his gun menacingly.</p>

<p>“I guess we’re not likely to stir, until we get
the anchor loose, at any rate,” remarked Jerry
coolly, for he had gotten over his fright when he
saw that the airship was not damaged.</p>

<p>Then, as the craft had no longer any forward
motion, and as this is vitally necessary to every
aeroplane, the <i>Comet</i> began to settle down rapidly,
almost on the roof of the barn.</p>

<small>HELD PRISONERS</small></h2>


<p>“Look out or we’ll turn turtle, if we hit the
barn!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, we can’t go down this way!” added Ned.
“Do something!”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m going to start the gas machine,”
said Jerry. “Keep cool now, there’s no
danger. By Jinks! But we seem to be having all
kinds of bad luck lately. First we kill a calf and
now we rip a barn apart. Well, it can’t be
helped.”</p>

<p>The gas bag had been partly inflated ready for
a landing at the balloon grounds, so that the
<i>Comet</i> did not come down as rapidly as would
otherwise have been the case. Jerry soon started
the vapor machine, forcing more of the lifting gas
into the container, and this further checked the
descent.</p>

<p>Almost as lightly as the proverbial feather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the <i>Comet</i> came down, resting on the ground near
the barn. As soon as she settled to rest, the anchor
also dropped beside her, for there being no
longer any upward strain on the sharp points to
force them into the wood, the weight pulled them
out.</p>

<p>The farmer stood there defiantly, covering the
boys with his gun, as they lined up on the deck of
the airship, with Professor Snodgrass, his arms
filled with specimen boxes, behind them, a puzzled
look on his face.</p>

<p>“What d’ ye mean, goin’ around th’ country,
rippin’ folks’ barn apart?” demanded the farmer
in surly tones.</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” replied Jerry gently.
“Our anchor and rope must have come loose, and
were dragging along through the air.”</p>

<p>“Come loose! I should say it did come loose!”
spluttered the man. “So did nearly half my barn
come loose! But I’ll have satisfaction for it.
Hey, Bill&mdash;Sam! Come here an’ help me take
care of these folks!”</p>

<p>He raised his voice and two husky hired men
came running from the direction of the house
which the boys could just make out through the
trees of the orchard.</p>

<p>“Now then, grab ’em!” yelled the farmer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
pointing his gun first at Jerry, then at Bob and
then at Ned, and then beginning at Jerry again.
“Grab ’em!” he cried, “an’ tie ’em up! There’s
plenty of clothes line, an’ th’ women folks ain’t
goin’ t’ wash t’-day.”</p>

<p>The hired men, grinning in appreciation of the
plight in which our friends found themselves, advanced
slowly.</p>

<p>“There’s no necessity for resorting to harsh
measures,” said Jerry with dignity. “We’re not
going to run away.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet ye ain’t!” chuckled the farmer. “Not
when I git through with ye! Tie ’em up, Sam an’
Bill.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried Jerry, seeing that it did no
good to be polite, “if you lay a hand on us, you’ll
get into trouble! We won’t stand for any such
treatment from you! The damage we did was
accidental, and we’re willing to pay&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s what ye will! Pay, an’ pay good an’
proper!” interrupted the unpleasant farmer.</p>

<p>“What do you think it’s worth?” asked Bob, as
Jerry went to look and see if the strain of the
anchor rope had done any harm to the airship.</p>

<p>“What do I think it’s wuth? Why, a thousand
dollars won’t cover my damage! I jest had that
barn repaired t’ hold my crops, an’ here ye come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
along, an’ rip it all t’ smithereens! A thousand
dollars&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Jerry, reappearing at
that moment. “A thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“He says we damaged his barn that much,” explained
Bob.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the tall lad.</p>

<p>“No nonsense about it!” spluttered the farmer.
“An’ ef ye don’t settle I’ll have ye arrested. Sam
an’ Bill I reckon ye’d better git them cords ready
arter all.”</p>

<p>“Why, we have only torn off a small piece of
the cornice and some of the eaves,” said Jerry,
pointing to where the damage had been done.</p>

<p>“Hu! It’s easy enough fer ye t’ say that,
young feller, but it ain’t so easy t’ git my barn
fixed. Either ye pay me a thousand dollars, or
ye go t’ jail, th’ hull three of ye&mdash;no, by gum!
There’s another one of ye&mdash;there’s four!” as he
caught sight of the professor who, seeing that he
could be of no service, was calmly looking over
his note-books. “Is he yer father?” asked the
farmer. “If he is, he can pay th’ damage. Folks
what go about in airships must have lots of
money.”</p>

<p>“No, he’s not our father,” replied Jerry
shortly, “and we haven’t lots of money. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
willing to pay you a reasonable sum for damaging
your barn, but a thousand dollars is out of
the question.”</p>

<p>“It is, eh? Well, mebby when ye’ve been in jail
a couple of days ye won’t think so. Sam an’ Bill,
take ’em, an’ tie ’em, while I hitch up, an’ git
ready t’ bring ’em over t’ Lafayette, t’ th’ court
house. I’ll show ’em they can’t make no monkey
of me!”</p>

<p>“Nature did that for you,” murmured Ned,
“and saved us the trouble.”</p>

<p>The two hired men, one of whom had secured
a clothes line, now advanced on our friends. The
farmer stood ready to back them up with his gun,
and the boys had had no chance to get a weapon,
even had they desired to do so, which they probably
did not, as they were not of the fighting class.</p>

<p>“You’d better not touch us!” threatened Jerry.</p>

<p>“No! Hands off!” ordered Bob.</p>

<p>“Hear ’em talk!” mocked Bill. “Do ye think
we kin handle ’em, Sam?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so. You take th’ tall feller, an’ I’ll
tackle th’ other two. Th’ old man looks harmless.”</p>

<p>“I’ll attend t’ him,” remarked the farmer. “I
reckon Si Muggins ain’t forgot how t’ shoot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The two hired men came rapidly forward.
Sam laid a hand on the shoulder of Bob. The fat
lad shrunk away, and looked to Jerry for a signal
as to what to do. That youth, as Bill approached
him, drew back his arm to deliver a blow. In
another moment there would have been a fight,
but the professor, looking up, and probably realizing
for the first time what was going on, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Easy, boys. We’ll arbitrate this. Let them
take you, and don’t resist. The proper authorities
will settle this.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they will!” declared Mr. Muggins,
shaking his gun. “Tie ’em up, Bill an’
Sam.”</p>

<p>“There’s no need for that,” said Jerry more
calmly. “We’ll go wherever you want to take
us.”</p>

<p>“All right; then lock ’em in th’ smoke house
until I kin hitch up,” decided the farmer, and,
with feelings of bitter humiliation in their hearts,
but resolving not to give in to the extortionate demands
of Mr. Muggins, the four meekly followed
the hired men.</p>

<p>A little later they were locked up, prisoners in
the stifling smoke house, where, in the fall, hams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and bacon were cured over a hickory fire. It was
dark, dirty and ill-smelling, and a great change
from their comfortable airship, which they could
just make out through the cracks in the smoke
house door, resting near the damaged barn.</p>

<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p>“Well, wouldn’t this jar you!”</p>

<p>That was what Bob said.</p>

<p>“Say, it reminds me of when I was little, and
used to get shut up in a dark closet for being
bad.”</p>

<p>That was Ned’s contribution to the general conversation.</p>

<p>“I wish we’d yanked over his whole barn, and
then gone on!”</p>

<p>This from Jerry, wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s too bad it’s so gloomy in here that
I can’t even see to read my notes, or look for any
specimens,” lamented Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>Then they remained silent for a few minutes,
going over in their minds their unpleasant situation.
They sat on some saw horses which had
been hastily thrust into their prison before the
door had been locked.</p>

<p>“Seems to be a pretty solid sort of a place,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
observed Ned, after a pause, during which he had
pounded and kicked on the sides of their shack.</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed Jerry. “They don’t use smoke
houses much any more, and as they were built
years ago, when the farmers had lots of time,
they made ’em solid. But I wonder how long
he’s going to keep us here? The old villain! To
have the nerve to ask us a thousand dollars for
damages. Why, a hundred would more than
pay him!”</p>

<p>“A hundred and fifty would, easily,” declared
Ned, “and I’d be willing to settle on that basis,
for we ought to be at Danforth now.”</p>

<p>They talked about their trouble for some time,
and after an hour or two one of the hired men
brought the prisoners some food. They ate
heartily and a little later Mr. Muggins approached
the smoke house.</p>

<p>“I can’t take you fellers over t’ court t’-day,”
he announced, “because one of my hosses is sick.
But I’ll take ye over fust thing in th’ mornin’, an’
I’ll have justice, too, unless ye want t’ pay me th’
thousand dollars now.”</p>

<p>“In the first place, we haven’t got it,” declared
Jerry, “and, if we did have, we’d never pay that
amount.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll hold ye fer th’ proper authorities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you going to keep us in this place all
night?” demanded the professor. “If you do you
will be liable for severe penalties.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t aimin’ t’ keep ye here over night,”
went on Mr. Muggins. “I’m goin’ t’ put ye in th’
harness room right away.”</p>

<p>A little later the transfer was made, and,
closely guarded, our friends were shifted to somewhat
better quarters, though seemingly none the
less secure. They were locked in a small room
where hung many old, and some new harnesses,
the apartment being partitioned off from the carriage
house. The door was locked, and they were
left alone, some blankets having been provided
for beds, and the assurance given that they would
soon have supper.</p>

<p>The day passed miserably and slowly. They
could not see their airship from where they now
were, and they feared lest something happen to it.
Talk lagged among the boys, but the professor
did not seem to mind his imprisonment, for he
had light now to see to work on his notes, and
he managed to capture several small bugs, which
he put in his boxes that he had carried into his
prison with him.</p>

<p>Supper was brought to them about dusk, and
Jerry took the opportunity to demand of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Muggins that they either be taken at once before
a magistrate, or released on payment of one
hundred and fifty dollars, which, he said was all
it would cost to repair the barn.</p>

<p>But Mr. Muggins was obstinate, and would not
listen to reason. He departed, locking the harness
room door securely after him.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well make up our minds to
spend the night here,” said Bob gloomily. “Anyhow,
I’m not hungry&mdash;at least for the present.”</p>

<p>“That’s a comfort,” observed Jerry somewhat
sarcastically. He was walking idly about
the room when his foot happened to knock against
a board near the floor.</p>

<p>Quickly he stooped over, and inserted his fingers
in a crack. There was just light enough left
from the fast-closing day, to show that the board
was loose.</p>

<p>“Look, fellows!” exclaimed the tall lad.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“This board! I believe we can kick it off and
get out!”</p>

<p>“Do it then!” urged Bob.</p>

<p>“No, not now,” said Jerry calmly. “It’s too
early, and they’d hear the noise. Wait until after
dark, when they’re all in bed, and we’ll escape.”</p>

<p>“But if we do get the board off,” objected Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
“we’ll only be out in the main room of the carriage
house.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” declared Jerry. “There are
low windows there, and the doors don’t fasten as
tightly as this one does. We can get out of the
carriage house easily enough, sneak to the airship,
and be off before that rascally farmer and
his hired men know what’s up.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Professor Snodgrass. “I’ll
help!”</p>

<p>They could hardly wait for the time to come.
It got very dark, for the lantern had been taken
away from them. At Jerry’s suggestion they
stretched out on the blankets and tried to rest until
it should be late enough to make the attempt to
escape.</p>

<p>They could hear movements about the barnyard,
and guessed that remedies were being administered
to the sick horse. At last, however, all
was quiet, and, waiting to give the farmer’s family
time to get asleep, our heroes began to make
ready to leave.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to get the board off, but
they finally managed it, and, after loosening another
by the exercise of all their strength, they
found they had a place big enough for them to
squeeze through. Bob found it hard work, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
account of his stoutness, and Ned and Jerry, who
got out first, had to pull their chum from in front,
while Professor Snodgrass pushed from behind.
But it was finally accomplished, though poor
Chunky said he felt as though his skin was all
scraped off him.</p>

<p>“Now to get out of this place!” exclaimed
Jerry eagerly. “It ought to be easy!”</p>

<p>They located a window, by the starlight shining
through it, and found that they could slide it
back. Then, by standing on boxes, they managed
to get out of it, and, a few minutes later they
found themselves on the ground, in the shadow of
the carriage house&mdash;free.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it’s good to be out again!” exclaimed
Ned, taking a long breath.</p>

<p>“No time for that now!” warned Jerry.
“Hurry to the airship!”</p>

<p>They found the <i>Comet</i> where it had landed. It
did not seem to have been touched, but it was
fastened to the earth by ropes, attached to several
stones as anchors.</p>

<p>“Get in!” ordered Jerry to his chums in a whisper.
“I’ll start the gas machine, and we’ll rise
like a balloon before starting the propellers.
Then they won’t hear us.”</p>

<p>Rapidly they climbed aboard. Soon the hissing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of the gas generator told that vapor was being
forced into the bag.</p>

<p>“Cast off!” ordered Jerry in a whisper, and
the retaining ropes were loosened.</p>

<p>Up shot the <i>Comet</i> as if glad to be free once
more. Higher and higher she rose, until she was
above the roof of the barn.</p>

<p>Then, just as Jerry was about to turn the power
into the motor and start the propellers, there was
the sound of a window being thrown up, and a
voice they recognized as that of Mr. Muggins’s
cried:</p>

<p>“Hold on there! Come back! Ye can’t escape
like that!”</p>

<p>There was a flash of fire, and a loud report.</p>

<p>“He’s shooting at us!” cried Bob.</p>

<small>AT THE BALLOON MEET</small></h2>


<p>Jerry was working frantically at the machinery.
Something seemed to be the matter with it,
and he had a fear that perhaps the farmer or his
men might have been tinkering with the motor.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we move?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s get out of here, or he’ll have us
back in that smoke house again!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Can I help?” demanded the professor, who
having placed his precious specimen boxes in a
safe place aboard the ship, was scurrying about
the deck in the darkness, without any special object
in view.</p>

<p>“I’m doing the best I can!” cried Jerry. “This
lever seems to be stuck!”</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” yelled the farmer again.
“I’ve got th’ drop on ye! I’m goin’ t’ shoot
ag’in!”</p>

<p>There was another flash of fire and a loud report.
By the gleam from the gun the boys could
see Mr. Muggins leaning out of his bedroom window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
pointing the weapon at them. But they
heard the bullet sing through the air, high over
their heads.</p>

<p>“He isn’t shooting at us!” cried Bob in a
hoarse whisper. “He’s aiming high!”</p>

<p>“That’s just the trouble!” murmured Jerry.
“He may put a hole through the gas bag! Hang
it all. What’s the matter with this lever, anyhow?”</p>

<p>As he spoke he gave it another sudden yank.
There was a clicking sound, a hum and purr that
became a muffled roar and then the motor started.
The big propellers whirled around and the <i>Comet</i>
shot ahead.</p>

<p>“Now we’re safe!” cried Ned. “Shoot away,
old man; you can’t hit us now!”</p>

<p>As if taking the lad at his word Mr. Muggins
fired again, but they did not hear the sound of
the bullet. Then, faint and far away, for they
were now some distance from the farmhouse,
came the threatening voice:</p>

<p>“I’ll catch you fellers yet! I know where ye’re
goin’ in that there balloon machine, an’ I’ll be
right arter ye! Ye can’t git away from old man
Muggins that way! I’ll have the sheriff on yer
trail!”</p>

<p>“Still, we <em>did</em> get away,” exulted Jerry, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I’d like to see you catch us now, Mr. Muggins!”
He turned more power into the motor and the
craft shot ahead faster than ever, while, back in
the darkness, an exceedingly angry farmer closed
his window with a bang and muttered dire threats
against the lads who had gotten the better of him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our heroes were scudding along
through the air. They did not venture to turn
on any lights for some time, fearing that perhaps
the ugly farmer, with a powerful rifle might manage
to aim at them, and puncture the gas bag.
But it did not take long to get out of range, and
then they lit up.</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do,” declared Bob,
as he started for the store room.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Chunky?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Get something to eat! That stuff Mrs. Muggins
sent us was all right, but there wasn’t enough
of it. Don’t you fellows want something? How
about you, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re the limit, Bob!” cried Jerry. “But
I suppose there’s no stopping you. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“We must be near Danforth,” remarked Ned,
a little later. “We don’t want to run past it,
Jerry, for we can’t see it in the dark.”</p>

<p>“No, and for that reason I’m going to slow
down now, and remain as stationary as the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
will let us. There is no use going a long distance
out of our way. I’ll fill the gas bag, and we’ll
float in the air until morning.”</p>

<p>This was soon done, and feeling very tired
from the experience they had just passed through
they all went to bed, leaving the <i>Comet</i> floating in
space, blown here and there by gentle breezes
which Jerry knew would not take them far out of
their course.</p>

<p>“See anything of the grounds where the balloon
meet is being held?” asked Jerry of Bob,
who was up early to make coffee.</p>

<p>The stout lad took an observation over the rail
of the craft before replying.</p>

<p>“Nothing like it in sight,” he answered. “We
seem to be over a farming country, and I can see
two or three men driving their teams along the
road. They’re looking up here and waving their
hands. That one fellow will dislocate his neck,
if he doesn’t look out.”</p>

<p>“Well, see to it that the anchor isn’t trailing,”
advised Jerry. “We can’t afford to rip off any
more barn roofs. By the way, I wonder if we
hadn’t ought to have left some money for Mr.
Muggins?”</p>

<p>“He was too mean,” declared Ned. “But we
must be careful not to have any more delays. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
getting nervous about not seeing Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p>“We’ll catch him to-day I guess,” declared
Jerry, as he got up to take an observation. By
looking at some maps which he had, he calculated
that they were within a few miles of Danforth,
having been blown a little out of their
course in the night. The motor was started, and
the <i>Comet</i> headed in the right direction.</p>

<p>Eagerly the boys kept watch for the first sight
of the big park where the balloon and aeroplane
meet was to take place. They knew it would be
visible some distance away, for there would be
tents erected as “hangars” for the balloons, and
probably the canvas shelters would be gay with
flags.</p>

<p>They were right. Half an hour later Bob, who
had gone away up forward, where he had an unobstructed
view, gave a shout.</p>

<p>“There it is!” he cried. “I see it! Crimps!
but it’s a big one. We’re all right, fellows, let’s
make a sensational landing, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked the tall lad, “turn
a somersault, or something like that?”</p>

<p>“No, but speed around, do some stunts and then
come down in the middle of the park.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll try it.”</p>

<p>And indeed Jerry was not a little proud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
what their craft could do, so he was willing to fall
in with Bob’s idea.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was sent up, and then directed
downward. Then Jerry put her through some intricate
evolutions, to show what control he had
of her.</p>

<p>Though it was early there was a big crowd on
the grounds and they were much interested in
what was going on. The boys could see thousands
of persons gazing up at them. They noted
numbers of tents and sheds which evidently
housed the big aircraft. There were several balloons
without shelter, the big bags, partly filled,
swaying in the wind.</p>

<p>One dirigible in particular attracted their attention.
It was very large, and seemed to have a
large boat-shaped cabin attached below it. In
fact, the lower part was not unlike their own
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>About this craft there was quite a throng, and
men could be seen busily engaged, evidently in
getting it ready for a flight.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ve done enough,” remarked
Jerry at length. “We’d better go down.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Ned. “I’d like to see what sort
of a craft that one is,” and he motioned to the
big dirigible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than there came a shout
from below, and the balloon rose swiftly in the
air.</p>

<p>“They’re making an early flight!” cried Bob.
“We missed ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can see from here just as well,” said
Jerry, as he checked the downward progress of
the <i>Comet</i> for a moment.</p>

<p>Upward shot the big dirigible, amid the cheers
of the onlookers, and then, wishing to make as
good a landing as possible, and needing good
speed and control to effect this, Jerry again sent
the motor-ship downward.</p>

<p>A little later the motor boys landed in the midst
of a big, green, open space, while the crowd
thronged up around them, cheering their impromptu
exhibition, and asking all sorts of questions.</p>

<p>“Here at last!” cried Ned, with a sigh of relief.
“Now to find Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p>Overhead the big dirigible was shooting forward
through space, for her propellers had been
set in motion. The boys watched her with great
interest, little knowing how their own fate was
interwoven in that of the strange craft.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>MR. JACKSON IS GONE</small></h2>


<p>“That’s a great machine!”</p>

<p>“Sort of cross between a dirigible and an aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“Wonder where they came from?”</p>

<p>“Say, how much speed can you make?”</p>

<p>“How high can you go?”</p>

<p>These were some of the comments and questions
that greeted our friends as they alighted
from their craft. They answered them as well as
they could, and, having anchored the <i>Comet</i>, for
there was some gas in the bag, that tended to
raise her, they made their way through the press
of people.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“To the office of the secretary, or some of the
officials of the meet,” answered Ned. “I want to
inquire about Mr. Jackson. I hope I have those
papers safe, that dad wants him to sign.”</p>

<p>He quickly felt in his pockets, assured himself
that the valuable documents were there, and kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
on with his companions. Professor Snodgrass
brought up in the rear, with his small butterfly
net over his shoulder, and an empty specimen
box in his hand, ready for whatever he might see
in the way of insects.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bob, Ned and Jerry were making
their way to where they had been told were the
offices of the company that had arranged the balloon
meet. As the boys walked along they asked
several men they met whether Mr. Jackson had
arrived, but they could obtain no information.
Either the persons were foreigners who had come
to do stunts in their aeroplanes, and could not
understand or speak much English, or else they
had heard nothing of the man whom the merchant’s
son was so anxious to meet.</p>

<p>“Well, the secretary will be sure to know,” decided
Ned, as, followed by his chums, he entered
the offices which were in a temporary building.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Wescott Jackson’s machine here yet?”
asked Ned, when he had found the proper official.</p>

<p>“It was here,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“<em>Was</em> here? Why, has he taken it away?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. It’s off on a trial trip.”</p>

<p>“Then where is Mr. Jackson?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gone, too&mdash;he went in his dirigible
balloon a little while ago. Didn’t you notice a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
craft going up, just as you came down?” asked
the secretary.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” replied Ned, while he felt a lump
come up in his throat. “Was Mr. Jackson
aboard?”</p>

<p>“Indeed he was. He is piloting his craft, and
he has a friend with him besides the crew. As I
said, he went off on a trial trip.”</p>

<p>“When is he coming back?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s hard to say.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean he won’t come back here at
all?” demanded Ned, as he felt of the documents
in his pocket&mdash;documents which it was so vital
that Mr. Jackson sign.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we expect him back,” was the answer.
“You see the meet officially opens to-day, and Mr.
Jackson has promised to give an exhibition flight.
Before venturing on that, however, he said he
wanted to give his machine a tryout, so he took it
up this morning. We expect him back almost any
time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s different,” said Ned, with an air of
relief. “I want to see him on very important
business, but we can wait until he returns.”</p>

<p>“I understand you have quite an airship yourself,”
went on the secretary. “Don’t you want to
enter her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys decided that they did not care to do
this, at least until after they had seen Mr. Jackson,
and obtained his signature.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’ll enter some of the contests
then,” remarked Jerry. “That is, if we may.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’d be glad to have you. In fact, if you
will give an exhibition flight this morning the committee
will pay you well for it. We expected to
have a well-known aviator here with his biplane,
but he has disappointed us, and we have nothing
with which to interest the crowds until afternoon.
So if you could fill in, we’d be much obliged to
you.”</p>

<p>“Let’s do it,” urged Bob eagerly.</p>

<p>“We might miss Mr. Jackson,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t go far away from the
grounds,” put in the secretary, “and you can see
Mr. Jackson’s balloon when it heads back this
way. I don’t believe he’ll go far off.”</p>

<p>“Might as well then, to pass the time,” suggested
Jerry, and as Ned was willing, under these
circumstances, the boys went back to their machine
to get it ready for a flight. But Ned kept anxious
eyes on the sky, watching for a first sight of the
returning dirigible.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>A MESSAGE FOR HELP</small></h2>


<p>“What sort of stunts are you going to try,
Jerry?” asked Ned, as the tall lad hurried here
and there about the <i>Comet</i>, looking to see that all
the machinery was properly adjusted.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. We’ll go up quite a distance&mdash;higher
than any of the craft they have
here, I guess, and we’ll do some aerial evolutions.
Then I thought we might show them how we
can change from a dirigible to an aeroplane and
back again, in mid-air, by letting the gas out of
the bag, and filling it again.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you demonstrate the hydroplanes,
too?” asked Bob, who, for some time now, had
not mentioned eating.</p>

<p>“Where’s the water?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“I saw a little lake over in that direction as
we were coming down,” announced the stout lad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
pointing toward the left. “It looked big enough
to land on, and even if you can’t scoot across it,
and rise from it, we can go up as a balloon.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll do it,” agreed Jerry. “Better
tell the secretary that if the crowd wants to see
that stunt they’ll have to hustle over.”</p>

<p>Bob took this information to the official, who
came hurrying over from his office, greatly delighted
at the prospect of having some attraction
to take the part on the program that was to have
been filled by the biplane. The secretary had announcements
made through megaphones, concerning
the prospective flight of the motor boys, and
telling of the hydroplane feature.</p>

<p>Matters were soon in readiness, and, after a
vain search for Professor Snodgrass, who, the
boys thought likely, was off gathering bugs, it
was decided to go up without him.</p>

<p>Up shot the <i>Comet</i> as Jerry turned on the gas.
Straight up into the air she went, for it was as a
dirigible balloon that the owners decided to show
their craft’s ability. Then, after doing some intricate
figures at a comparatively low elevation,
Jerry went out after a height record.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that he got it, for the
barograph registered a little over three miles
when they started to descend. They would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
have had to come down then, only they ran into a
cold snowstorm in the upper regions, and they
did not want to take any chances.</p>

<p>When they landed, and the officials gave out
the verified figures of their climb into space there
was a hearty cheer. Jerry, with the aid of his
chums, next showed what their craft could do as
an aeroplane. She was sent skimming along the
ground on the bicycle wheels, and, when enough
momentum had been acquired, the steersman
tilted the elevation rudder and up soared the
<i>Comet</i> again.</p>

<p>This time the stunt of sailing along as an aeroplane,
suddenly stopping the propellers, and
changing to the form of a dirigible balloon was
successfully accomplished, to the delight of the
watching throng.</p>

<p>“Now for the hydroplanes!” Jerry announced
to Bob and Ned, giving the signal agreed upon
to those below. The press of people made a rush
for the little lake about half a mile distant, and
the boys waited until most of the crowd lined the
shores before starting toward it.</p>

<p>Then, after sailing swiftly above the surface of
the water Jerry suddenly began a descent. While
Bob and Ned managed the craft Jerry stood
ready at the hydroplane levers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell me when to shunt them into place,” he
called to Bob who was on the lookout.</p>

<p>“Now!” suddenly shouted the stout lad.</p>

<p>The lever snapped forward, the floats on the
toggle-jointed arms went downward, while the
bicycle wheels came up and, a moment later, the
<i>Comet</i> was afloat.</p>

<p>A cheer went up from the crowd, and there was
continued hearty applause for a feat that has seldom
been seen, save very recently in airship
circles.</p>

<p>Jerry put the craft slowly about on the lake, and
then as it was drawing toward noon, when other
aeroplane “stunts” would be the order of the day,
and as they were anxious to see if they could sight
Mr. Jackson returning, it was decided to go back
to the aviation park.</p>

<p>Another cheer greeted the ability of our heroes,
as they headed their craft for the park, and the
crowd streamed back below them.</p>

<p>“See anything of the dirigible?” asked Jerry,
as Ned was anxiously scanning the air all about
them.</p>

<p>“No,” was the somewhat despondent answer.
“Mr. Jackson’s machine doesn’t appear to be in
sight.”</p>

<p>“Try with the glasses,” suggested the tall lad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
passing to the merchant’s son a pair of powerful
binoculars. “Maybe you can pick him up with
those.”</p>

<p>Ned swept the horizon, and pointed the glasses
to the zenith, taking in all the intervening space
as well as he could. But the sight of a black
speck, which could be focussed into a dirigible
balloon, did not greet his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he’ll come back sooner or later,”
declared Jerry. “Perhaps he went farther than
he intended to.”</p>

<p>“Sure, he’ll come back,” added Bob. “We do
seem to have the greatest luck missing that man.
Everywhere we go we are just too late.”</p>

<p>“I hope not this time,” said Ned in a low voice.
“The only thing that’s worrying me is that he
may have met with some accident, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” exclaimed Jerry. “If there
had been an accident we’d have heard of it. The
grounds here are connected by telegraph with
New York City and the whole country for that
matter. In fact we’re only a few miles from New
York. We must try a trip across it before we go
back to Cresville.”</p>

<p>“That’ll make the people in the skyscrapers
look out of the windows and get stiff necks,” predicted
Bob with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>As they landed and made fast their craft, in a
sheltered space set aside for them by the secretary
of the meet, the boys were aware of some excitement
around a small building near the committee
offices.</p>

<p>“What’s going on over there I wonder?”
asked Ned, as he saw a crowd running toward it,
and surrounding a man in his shirt sleeves, who
held a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>“We’ll go over and see,” suggested Jerry.
“Maybe Professor Snodgrass has just discovered
a pink flea on a yellow dog, or has picked some
new kind of July bug from a lady’s hat.”</p>

<p>As they neared the place they saw by a sign on
the temporary wooden building that it was a telegraph
office, and also one where wireless messages
could be received and sent.</p>

<p>“It’s news from somewhere, evidently,” commented
Ned.</p>

<p>They pushed their way through the press of
people.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried several. “Read it to us!”</p>

<p>“I will, if you’ll be quiet,” answered the man
with the fluttering paper in his hand. “This is a
wireless message I just received from Mr. Wescott
Jackson. It was sent from his dirigible balloon
<i>Manhattan</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Read it!” cried the impatient throng.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” went on the man, and read as follows:</p>

<p>“‘We are disabled and are being blown out to
sea in the grip of an upper-air hurricane! Send
help, if possible!’”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>


<p>Silence greeted the reading of the message&mdash;silence
at first, and then, as the import of the
appeal came home to the crowd, there were murmurs
of surprise and despair.</p>

<p>“Blown out to sea!” exclaimed Jerry. “How
could they be over the ocean so soon after leaving
here? They must have travelled at a terrific
rate.”</p>

<p>“You forget,” said Bob, “that we’re within a
few miles of New York, and not far from the
sea. It’s only a short distance to the ocean.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “And if they’re
in a hurricane of the upper air they may be swept
along for several days.”</p>

<p>“But we must help them!” exclaimed Professor
Snodgrass, who had temporarily abandoned his
pursuit after specimens and had joined his friends
in the crowd. “They have appealed to us all for
aid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right!” cried several. “We must go
to the rescue. We must send out a relief expedition.
Notify the naval authorities, and have a
swift torpedo boat sent out to pick them up in
case they fall into the sea. All ship captains
should be notified by wireless.”</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that part of it,” promised the
wireless operator who was stationed on the aviation
grounds.</p>

<p>“But in which direction are they being blown?”
asked Jerry. “Which way should the ships look
for them? Did the message say?”</p>

<p>The operator shook his head.</p>

<p>“It just says that they are being blown out to
sea,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Ned. “Get into communication
with them again! Call them on the wireless and
ask which way they are being blown.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” shouted several in the crowd.</p>

<p>The operator made a jump for his instruments,
and soon there was snapping through the air of
the wireless waves, directed toward the runaway
and disabled balloon.</p>

<p>There were several minutes of anxious waiting,
while the crackling sounds could plainly be heard,
so quiet was it. Suddenly Ned uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Jackson!” replied the merchant’s son.
“Mr. Jackson is on that disabled balloon. He is
being blown out to sea and he may never be rescued.
Then my father’s business will fail! Oh,
what luck&mdash;what fearful luck we’ve had since we
set out to find him! We can’t seem to get in touch
with him, and every day’s delay makes it worse
for poor dad!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Jerry, “that’s so! I forgot
for the moment that we need to see Mr. Jackson,
and he’s on that balloon, over the ocean. I
guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jerry was interrupted by the reappearance of
the wireless operator. There was a despondent
look on the man’s face.</p>

<p>“Did you hear from them?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s of no use,” he answered. “I called and
called, and finally I did manage to pick them up;
I started to ask them their direction, but their operator
broke in on me.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Just one word,” was the answer, “just one
word&mdash;‘help!’ That’s all.”</p>

<p>Once more came an ominous silence.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t we send help?” suddenly
asked a man in the throng. “Here we are at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
balloon and aviation meet, and one of the aircraft
needs help. There are several balloons on hand,
and any number of aeroplanes. Why don’t some
of them start out to sea, and try to find Mr. Jackson
and his crowd?”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff! Go to the rescue!” was the
general cry.</p>

<p>It was a most practical suggestion, but when it
came to the matter of applying it, trouble developed
at once. Inquiries were made among the
several balloonists and aviators as to which craft
would be the best to send to aid the unfortunate
men, who might, perhaps, even then, be in danger
of death.</p>

<p>“Send the big balloon <i>North America</i>,” said
the man who had made the suggestion.</p>

<p>“I can’t go in her,” replied the pilot of the aircraft.
“Mine isn’t a dirigible, and I’m at the
mercy of the wind when I get up. An aeroplane
is what you need.”</p>

<p>“There’s the <i>New Yorker</i>!” came from several,
and they started toward the shed where a
large biplane, capable of carrying four passengers,
was housed.</p>

<p>“No use,” answered the owner of that craft.
“I wouldn’t dare go over the ocean in her.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Ned eagerly. For more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
reasons than one he wanted to see Mr. Jackson
rescued.</p>

<p>“In the first place, my craft is not reliable
enough,” was the reply. “I might take a tumble
into the sea myself. Then, again, I can’t carry
gasolene enough for a long flight, and, even if I
did sight the <i>Manhattan</i> I couldn’t do the people
on her any good.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” again demanded the man who had
made the suggestion. “Didn’t the steamer <i>Trent</i>
rescue Wellman and his crew from the dirigible
balloon <i>America</i> at sea?”</p>

<p>“They did,” was the reply, “but the <i>Trent</i>
could come to a stop. I can’t come to a stop
without falling into the sea. What is needed is a
balloon or aeroplane that can remain stationary
in the air.”</p>

<p>As if by common consent the eyes of nearly
every person in the crowd were turned toward the
motor boys. Their craft which had been put
through her paces that day, travelling on the
water as well as through the air&mdash;which had come
to a halt while nearly a mile high and had floated
as easily as a feather&mdash;that craft&mdash;the <i>Comet</i>
seemed to offer a solution of the problem. The
boys felt it themselves, and perhaps only their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
modesty had prevented them from offering their
services before.</p>

<p>“Say!” cried the man who seemed to have
taken charge of matters, “I guess it’s up to you
boys! Will you go to the rescue?”</p>

<p>He addressed himself to Jerry. The tall lad
glanced at his companions. They nodded their
heads in assent. As for Professor Snodgrass
there was an eager look on his face.</p>

<p>“Go! Go!” he whispered to Jerry. “It’s the
very chance I need to get my singing fish.”</p>

<p>Jerry hesitated but a moment longer.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he answered, “we’ll go.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the man who had taken the
initiative. Later the boys learned that he was
Mr. Durkin, manager of the meet. “That’s the
way to talk, boys! Here we have a whole lot
of aircraft, and only one really fit for practical
work. Now, then, how about gasolene? Have
you enough for a big trip? There’s no telling
how long you may be gone. Those upper-air hurricanes
sometimes last for a week.”</p>

<p>“We’ll need to refill our gasolene tanks,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll attend to that part for you,” said
Mr. Durkin. “There are hundreds of gallons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the stuff here on the grounds. You look over
your motor and machinery. It won’t do to have
it break down. How about provisions?”</p>

<p>“Enough for a month!” cried Bob, and when
his chums laughed the crowd wondered why. But
for once Bob had the advantage, and he knew it.
Only for the stocking of the craft with a big supply
of food would it be possible to go on a long
trip. And had it not already been aboard there
would have been a long delay.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows, if we’re going, we’d better see
to the <i>Comet</i>,” proposed Jerry. “Come on, hustle!
Professor Snodgrass&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Right here!” cried the little scientist eagerly.
“I’ll do anything you say. Oh, to think that at
last we are to go to sea where I may get my
singing fish! What shall I do?”</p>

<p>He was anxious to help, and for the time being
forgot all about gathering ordinary specimens.
Jerry mentioned several tasks which the little man
could well attend to.</p>

<p>Soon there were busy scenes about the <i>Comet</i>.
Gasolene was being poured into her reserve tanks.
Bob took a last look at the provisions, and added
several boxes and packages of food that kind
friends offered. At Mr. Durkin’s suggestion
some medicines were taken along, also some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
planks and ropes to be used in the possible rescue.</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned went over the machinery, and
found that it was all right. Not a bolt was
strained, not a nut loosened. The <i>Comet</i> was fit
to make a flight half way across the Atlantic if
need be.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’re about ready to start,” announced
Jerry, after a last look over the machinery.
There were many offers of help from persons
in the crowd, but there was little they could
do. Many also begged to be taken on the rescue
trip, but these, of course, had to be refused.</p>

<p>“The sooner we get started the better,” spoke
Ned, as he started on a run across the aviation
grounds.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“To send a message to dad. I want to tell him
where we are going, and the reason why I haven’t
been able to get in touch with Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. Send word to my folks,
and to Bob’s also.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” called back Ned.</p>

<p>Soon a message was being flashed to his
father, and to the other folks in Cresville. While
waiting for a reply from his parent, Ned suggested
to the operator that he try once again to
get into communication with the <i>Manhattan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Through space the wireless messages clicked,
but silence was the only answer.</p>

<p>“It’s of no use,” said the operator gloomily.
“They may all be dead now.”</p>

<p>Ned, too, felt the seriousness of the situation,
but he was not going to give up so soon. Once
more the instruments clicked.</p>

<p>“It’s a message for you,” spoke the operator.
Ned read the dots and dashes, for he and his
chums could both send and receive wireless and
ordinary telegraphic messages.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” wired Mr. Slade to his son. “We
all send our best wishes to you boys. Do your
best to see Mr. Jackson, Ned. Vitally necessary
to rescue him, for our own sakes. My business is
in very poor shape. I am ruined unless Mr. Jackson
lends me his aid and influence. Get to him
if at all possible!”</p>

<p>“And I will, too!” declared the merchant’s son
with a grim tightening of his lips.</p>

<p>He hurried back to where the <i>Comet</i> waited
but the movement of a lever to launch her into
space and off to the rescue. Briefly Ned told his
chums of the message.</p>

<p>“Are you all ready?” asked Mr. Durkin.</p>

<p>“All ready,” replied Jerry. “Get aboard, Professor,
we are going to start.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything had been done that human foresight
could think of to make the rescue a success.
Jerry took his position in the steering tower.</p>

<p>Slowly he pulled the starting lever toward him.
In another instant the <i>Comet</i> would dart forward.
But, before the tall lad could pull the handle, a
man pushed his way through the crowd, laid his
hand on the rail of the aircraft and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I forbid this balloon to leave the grounds!”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Jerry, leaning out of the
window of the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Because I’ve got an attachment against it for
a thousand dollars, and it can’t go until that
amount is paid to Mr. Silas Muggins for damage
you did to his barn. You and your machine are
in the grip of the law!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>OVER THE OCEAN</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments after this unexpected announcement
neither of the motor boys knew what
to say. Nor did Professor Snodgrass seem able
to utter anything in keeping with the seriousness
of the occasion. As for Mr. Durkin, and the officers
of the meet, who were anxious for our heroes
to start on the rescue expedition, they gazed
blankly at the sheriff’s officer, whom they correctly
guessed the man to be.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that we can’t leave in our own
motor-ship?” demanded Jerry, stepping out on
deck.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I mean,” was the reply.
“I’m Deputy Sheriff Morton, and I’ve got an attachment
on this airship, or whatever you call it.
I’m in possession now, and I forbid you to leave
this place with the ship,” saying which Mr. Morton
jumped aboard.</p>

<p>“I guess you fellers will sing a different tune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
now!” exclaimed another voice, and pushing
through the crowd came Mr. Muggins himself, a
grim smile on his wrinkled features. “You
thought you’d git ahead of me, sneakin’ off in
th’ night, but I allowed as how you’d point fer
this balloon fair. So I jest hitched up, went t’ th’
sheriff an’ swore out an attachment ag’in ye, an’
here I be. Ye don’t stir till ye pay my thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t owe you a thousand dollars!”
exclaimed Ned, to whom every moment of delay
seemed an hour, so anxious was he to do something
to save his father’s business.</p>

<p>“Ye damaged my barn that amount, an’ ye’ve
got t’ pay it; ain’t they, Mr. Morton?”</p>

<p>“That’s what th’ law says. I’m in possession,”
and the sheriff’s deputy coolly took a seat in the
cabin of the motor-ship, and looked through the
opened windows at the crowd. There had been
murmurs of indignation when Mr. Morton prevented
the ship from leaving, but at this explanation
several inquiries were made as to how the
affair had originated.</p>

<p>Jerry briefly explained the accident, stating that
the barn was only slightly damaged, and he told
of the shabby treatment accorded him and his
chums by Mr. Muggins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you don’t seem to understand the seriousness
of this, my dear man,” said Mr. Durkin to
the farmer. “Are you aware that you may be the
cause of a number of persons losing their lives in
the balloon <i>Manhattan</i>, unless these lads are allowed
to go to the rescue? Do you realize that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t realize nothin’, but that I want a thousand
dollars,” asserted Mr. Muggins.</p>

<p>“No, I guess money is all you ever do realize,”
murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“I appeal to you,” pleaded Mr. Durkin, to the
sheriff’s deputy. “Can’t you let this airship go?
You will be responsible for the deaths of several
people if you prevent the rescue.”</p>

<p>“No use appealing to me,” declared Mr. Morton.
“I ain’t responsible for anything but my
duty. I have to do as the law says, and as I’ve
sworn to do. Pay the thousand dollars, and I’ll
take off the legal attachment, and the craft can
go. But I ain’t allowed to do otherwise.”</p>

<p>Clearly he was within his rights.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Muggins will release his claim temporarily,
I won’t say a word,” went on Mr. Morton.
“It’s up to him. I can vacate the attachment if he
says so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t say so!” cried the disagreeable
man. “I know my rights an’ I’m goin’ t’ have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
’em! I want a thousand dollars fer damages t’
my barn!”</p>

<p>There seemed to be no way of getting around
it, and it looked as if the <i>Comet</i> would have to
stay there, for the boys did not have a thousand
dollars, and it would take some time to procure it
from home, even if they were disposed to allow
themselves to be swindled in that fashion.</p>

<p>“Can’t we make a sudden dash, and get away?”
whispered Ned to Jerry. “We could take the
sheriff’s man with us if we had to.”</p>

<p>Jerry shook his head.</p>

<p>“It would be too risky,” the tall lad decided.
“He might draw a gun, and fire at the gas bag,
or something. Besides it would mean an extra
person on board, and if we rescue Mr. Jackson
and his friend and crew, we’re going to be pretty
well crowded as it is. I dare not chance it.”</p>

<p>Gloom settled on Ned’s face. Bob did not
know what to do. Jerry was at a loss. Professor
Snodgrass seemingly had put all thoughts of
trouble out of his mind, and was poring over
his note-books. Suddenly, however, the little scientist
looked up, and, addressing Mr. Morton,
asked:</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we give a bond of indemnity for
double the amount of the damages&mdash;say for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
thousand dollars? If we did that, guaranteeing
the payment to Mr. Muggins of his claim when it
was properly proved, couldn’t we be allowed to
go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that might be done,” admitted the deputy.
“I am authorized to accept a good bond.
But who would give it?”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Mr. Snodgrass eagerly. Hope
showed on the faces of the motor boys. But the
sheriff’s man shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you. You’re a stranger to me,”
he declared. “I don’t know whether you’re good
for the bond or not.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you that I <em>am</em>, and these boys know
it,” said the scientist innocently.</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” declared the officer.</p>

<p>“How about <em>my</em> bond?” suddenly asked Mr.
Durkin. “You know me. I’ll sign the bond for
two thousand dollars so these boys can go to the
rescue. Will you take it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll take <em>your</em> bond,” agreed the officer.</p>

<p>“Then come over to the office, and I’ll sign it!”
went on Mr. Durkin eagerly. “There’s no time
to lose. Get started, boys!”</p>

<p>The deputy came slowly down from the airship.
Mr. Muggins looked puzzled and disappointed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
He did not understand the matter of
the bond. He wanted the cash.</p>

<p>“Now’s your time, Jerry!” exclaimed Ned suddenly,
as he saw the officer alight on the ground.
“Start her up!”</p>

<p>“Sure! Everything is clear!” added Bob eagerly.</p>

<p>Jerry nodded comprehendingly. With a last
look to see that everything was in order he yanked
the starting lever toward him. The <i>Comet</i> shot
forward across the smooth ground on her bicycle
wheels, for the boys were going to send her aloft
as an aeroplane, saving their lifting gas for emergencies.
Faster and faster the craft moved, the
crowd parting to make way for her. Mr. Muggins
saw his prize getting away from him.</p>

<p>“Here!” he cried. “Here! Come back! I
want my thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>After the <i>Comet</i> he ran, his coat tails flying in
the wind, while, over and over again, he cried:</p>

<p>“Come back! Come back! I want my money!
The money for my barn. Hi! Mr. Sheriff, them
fellers is escapin’!”</p>

<p>“Faster Jerry!” cried Ned. “He may catch us,
and hang on!”</p>

<p>“Not much!” remarked the tall lad grimly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
He put on more speed. Then, seeing that they
were going fast enough to rise in the air, he pulled
the elevating rudder lever.</p>

<p>Up shot the <i>Comet</i>, while the crowd cheered.
Up and up she went, leaving a much chagrined
farmer running breathlessly and uselessly after it,
meanwhile shaking his fists at our heroes in the
air.</p>

<p>“Off at last!” murmured Ned with a sigh of
relief. “Off to the rescue!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I hope we’ll be in time to save them,”
added Jerry somewhat solemnly.</p>

<p>“I hope we get the singing fish,” spoke the
professor. “That is,” he went on quickly, “after
we save those poor people in the balloon!”</p>

<p>Higher and higher into the air went the <i>Comet</i>.
The tents and buildings in the aviation park
looked like tiny structures now. Soon the grounds
had disappeared from sight. The great city of
New York and her surrounding boroughs loomed
up in the distance.</p>

<p>In a little while they were over the great city,
but so high up that the boys could not see the
wondering crowds which they knew must be
watching their progress.</p>

<p>“Over the Hudson,” remarked Bob, as they
flew high above that historic river. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
proceeded down toward the Battery, out over
the Narrows, faster and ever faster, past the
forts at the entrance to the harbor, out beyond
Coney Island, leaving Atlantic Highlands on their
right, out past Sandy Hook, on and on, the water
widening more and more until finally Jerry announced.</p>

<p>“Over the ocean at last! Now, fellows, we’ve
got to keep up our spunk and courage, and depend
on ourselves. This is the riskiest trip we’ve ever
undertaken. All hands keep a sharp watch out
for the runaway balloon!”</p>

<p>Onward they sped, and they little knew what
was before them.</p>

<small>IN THE HURRICANE</small></h2>


<p>“Well, now we’re well started, I think I’ll go
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See about dinner, or supper or breakfast, or
something like that; eh, Chunky?” interrupted
Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Hu? How’d you know?” asked the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Oh, I could tell by the expression of your
face,” remarked the merchant’s son. “Whenever
you begin that way you can generally be depended
on, Bob, to say something about eating.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you hungry, Jerry?” and the stout lad
appealed for vindication to his tall chum.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” he admitted. “Go ahead, Bob,
and get something ready while Ned and I take
a look around the machinery and see if it’s working
all right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager Ned’s hungry, too, only he won’t
admit it,” murmured the fat lad as he started
toward the galley.</p>

<p>They had been making good progress and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had been some time since they had eaten, for
the alarming message about the unmanageable dirigible
balloon, and the excitement that followed,
had driven all thoughts of meals from their
minds. Now, however, in spite of Ned’s joking,
everyone was glad Bob had mentioned eating.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was sailing along over the ocean,
not making any great speed, for Jerry and his
chums had not yet decided what course to follow.
It was rather like searching in the dark, for they
did not know in which direction to look for the
<i>Manhattan</i>. They could only cruise about, trusting
to chance to put them on the right path.</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned found that the machinery was
working well, and the tall lad, on his return to
the pilot house, ventured to speed up the motor
slightly. Meanwhile Bob was busy with the meal,
which would be a cross between a late dinner and
an early supper.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had laid aside his note-books,
and had put away his specimen boxes.
Now, with a small but powerful telescope he was
seated on the forward deck of the motor-ship,
eagerly scanning the ocean below him for a sight
of the flying singing fish.</p>

<p>“Do you expect to find it so near land, Professor?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, hardly, yet I must not let a chance escape
me. Even if I don’t get the fish I want right
away, I may see some other specimen I need.
You can descend whenever you want to, can’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but you’d better talk to Jerry
about that part of it.”</p>

<p>The professor lost no time in interviewing the
tall lad, for he wanted to be ready to have the
<i>Comet</i> drop to the surface of the ocean at a
moment’s notice, in case he saw a specimen he
desired to catch.</p>

<p>“Yes, we can go down almost any time except
when it’s too rough,” said Jerry. “In fact, I was
thinking of going down shortly to see how the
hydroplanes worked on salt water. They ought
to do better than in fresh, as salt water is more
buoyant. We’ll go down as soon as we have
something to eat.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the professor can be excused for hurrying
through with his meal, as he was anxious to
get down to the surface of the sea. Jerry, too,
wondered how his new attachment would work
when there was a swell on, for, up to now, he had
only tested the hydroplanes on comparatively
smooth water.</p>

<p>“Well, here we go,” he announced, when, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
getting up from the table, they had all gathered
in the pilot house ready for the descent. “Ned,
you take charge of the air rudder, will you? And
Bob, you stand here ready to throw in the gears
of the water propeller when I give the word. I’m
going to stand by the hydroplane lever.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do?” asked the professor
eagerly. “I’d like to help.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can manage,” replied Jerry.
“Pull the depressing handle, Ned.”</p>

<p>The merchant’s son yanked the lever toward
him. Almost instantly the <i>Comet</i> pointed her
nose toward the ocean that rolled below them.
The boys were now practically out of sight of
land.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass, seeing that he could be of
no service, again took up his telescope to scan
the water for a possible sight of some fish specimen,
though he did not hope to so soon get the
prize he sought.</p>

<p>“We’re almost down,” murmured Ned, who
was keeping watch through a glass window in the
floor of the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jerry. “Now, Ned, stand
ready to haul up on the bicycle wheels when I give
the word.”</p>

<p>The three boys were on the alert. Would the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
new attachment work on the ocean? They were
all anxious to know.</p>

<p>“Now, Bob and Ned!” called Jerry suddenly.</p>

<p>Ned hauled up the bicycle wheels, which were
on jointed arms. Bob threw the gears of the
water propeller into mesh, while Jerry lowered
the toggle-jointed arms to which were attached
the hydroplanes.</p>

<p>Down upon the surface of the ocean settled
the <i>Comet</i>, and then, as Jerry started the motor
which revolved the water propeller, the craft
darted forward with an easy motion like some
graceful yacht.</p>

<p>“How about it?” asked Bob eagerly.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” declared Jerry. “The
hydroplanes work as well on the ocean as they did
on the lake. Boys, it’s a great success. Now
if we find Mr. Jackson and his friends we can
rescue them in the air or on the water!”</p>

<p>They moved along for a mile or more upon the
surface of the sea. Of course their progress was
not as smooth as in the air, for there was a rolling,
heaving motion to the ocean waves. But as
our heroes were used to travel in a big motor-boat,
they did not mind the swell.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass did not see his singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
fish, nor did he have great hopes that he would.
He used a small net which was sunk to some little
depth by means of weights, but he did not get
any valuable specimens. Only one small fish rewarded
his efforts.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for it myself,” he said, “but
I have a friend who will like it for his collection,”
and he put it into a jar of water to
save it.</p>

<p>As the afternoon was waning Jerry decided to
ascend into the air again, and so, starting the
larger propellers, in order to get more speed,
they mounted upward, and once more were on
their way, searching for the disabled balloon.</p>

<p>But the welcome sight of the <i>Manhattan</i> did
not greet them, and darkness was fast coming on.
The great searchlight was kindled and with the
glowing beam shooting ahead of them they continued
on through space.</p>

<p>All night they travelled, one or the other of
the boys being on the watch all the while, searching
the heavens for a glimpse of a moving light
that would indicate the presence of the craft they
sought. But morning came with no success.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I think we ought to do,”
spoke Bob, after breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“What; eat again?” asked Ned, with a wink
at Jerry.</p>

<p>“No. Now cut out that joking, can’t you? I
think we ought to go higher up, say a couple of
miles. The air will be clearer, and we can see
farther.”</p>

<p>“Good idea, Chunky!” declared Jerry. “We’ll
do it. Maybe we can see the balloon, then.”</p>

<p>The motor was speeded up, and in a short time,
with her elevating rudders tilted skyward, the
<i>Comet</i> was climbing higher into the air. When
the barograph measured fourteen thousand feet
height Jerry sent the craft along at that level,
while all on board peered eagerly about for the
<i>Manhattan</i>.</p>

<p>They had been travelling on this way for perhaps
two hours, and Jerry was wondering how
far they might venture out over the ocean, when
Ned asked:</p>

<p>“Why are you speeding up the motor? Aren’t
we going fast enough?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t put on any more speed,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Look at the tractometer,” was Ned’s reply,
and glancing at the instrument Jerry saw, with a
start, that they were going about seventy-five miles
an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s odd,” he remarked, “the motor is only
set for about forty.”</p>

<p>“What can be the matter?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke they noticed that the needle
of the dial on the tractometer slowly swung
around until it pointed to ninety miles. At the
same time they were aware that there was a
curious humming sound in the air outside.</p>

<p>“We must have struck a swiftly-moving current
of air,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>Once more they looked at the tractometer. It
now registered a hundred miles an hour, and the
sound outside increased to a roar.</p>

<p>Suddenly the <i>Comet</i> gave a sickening dive,
and almost turned turtle. Only the new fin-keels
Jerry had put on, and the automatic equilibrium
machine, saved them from being turned over.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Professor Snodgrass,
coming into the steering tower.</p>

<p>“It must be an upper-air hurricane!” gasped
Jerry. “The same kind that caught the <i>Manhattan</i>!
We’re in its power!”</p>

<p>The wind was now howling and roaring outside
the motor-ship, which plunged and careened
in the air like a ship in a storm on the ocean.
Faster and faster she scudded along in the gale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
more rapidly than her motors could take her, even
at top speed.</p>

<p>“We must go down!” gasped Jerry hoarsely.
“Go down, or we may be ripped all apart!” And
he sprang to the lever of the depressing rudder.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>A CLEW</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments it seemed to the Motor
Boys that the end of everything had come. It
appeared impossible that their comparatively frail
craft could weather the storm in the very heart of
which she was being hurled along. Now tilted
with her bow toward the earth; again, almost
standing on her tail rudders; now on her port
beam, and again on the starboard&mdash;the gallant
<i>Comet</i> struggled on in the grip of the hurricane.</p>

<p>“Lend a hand, fellows!” gasped Jerry, as he
tried in vain to bring the lever of the depressing
rudder toward him. “Lend a hand! The wind
pressure is so strong that I can’t work this alone.”</p>

<p>Bob and Ned sprang to their chum’s aid, and
even then the task was almost more than that
to which their combined strength was equal. Professor
Snodgrass, seeing their trouble, was about
to give them some assistance, when an instant’s
lull in the gale so relieved the pressure on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
planes that they were able to bring the lever to
the right position.</p>

<p>“Jove, but it blows!” cried Ned. “It’s a wonder
it didn’t rip off the wings, rudders and everything
else.”</p>

<p>“Lucky thing for us they’re of double
strength,” added Bob, for with the remodeling of
the motorship, the wing-planes and rudders had
been strengthened.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll be all right, now,” observed
Jerry. “We must have gotten into the hurricane
by coming up so high. I’ll stay at a lower level
after this.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it’s the same gale that Mr.
Jackson and the others were caught in?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder a bit,” was the reply of the
tall lad. “And if they’re in it, and it’s still blowing
at this rate, they’ll be carried half-way across
the Atlantic before we can catch them.”</p>

<p>“My gracious!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass,
“half-way across the Atlantic! That will
be just the thing for me. I can get my singing
fish then.”</p>

<p>“I hope we don’t have to go that far to rescue
them,” spoke Jerry. “But if we don’t soon get
out of this wind we may not get anywhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“We don’t seem to be going down out of it
very fast,” observed Ned, with a glance at the
barograph. It still registered nearly two miles
above sea level.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Jerry with a look at the
instrument. “I wonder if anything could have
happened to the depressing rudder. Maybe it
doesn’t work, or it may be disconnected from the
lever. In that case&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll go outside and look,” volunteered Ned,
clinging to the side wall of the pilot house in which
they all were.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll go,” decided Jerry. “It’s risky,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> want to take all the risk,” interrupted
Bob. “Let me go. I’m shorter than you, and the
wind won’t have so much surface to blow on.
I’ll go.”</p>

<p>It did seem wise to let the smaller lad venture
outside on the stern deck, and inspect the rudder,
and after some argument Jerry consented to this.
By going out of the rear door of the main cabin,
Bob would, in a measure, be sheltered by the deck
structures.</p>

<p>The force of the gale may be imagined when
it is said that as Bob stepped out he felt himself
fairly forced down toward the deck, as if some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
giant hand had pushed him. The power of the
wind was terrific, and, realizing this, the stout lad
got down as low as possible, and fairly crawled on
his hands and knees to a place where he could
see the rudder.</p>

<p>“It’s there, all right,” he reported pantingly to
his chums, when he had worked his way back to
the cabin.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t we go down?” asked Ned.
“Is it set to send us down, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I believe it’s because the wind is so powerful
that we can’t cut our way downward through the
level strata of the hurricane,” was Jerry’s opinion.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s this way, and I think Jerry is right,” spoke
Mr. Snodgrass. “We’re sailing along on an almost
solidified bank of air, which is compressed
by great pressure. To go below, into an area
where there is no storm, it is like cutting through
a layer of thick ice to get to the water beneath.
But the air buoys us up so that we’re having difficulties.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” inquired Ned
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something, that’s evident,”
responded the tall lad, as a sudden burst of the
storm once more nearly made the <i>Comet</i> turn
turtle. “We’ve got to get out of this.”</p>

<p>Jerry went to the engine-room, and called to
Bob and Ned to accompany him. He began adjusting
the machinery.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Key up the motor,” explained the tall lad.
“We’ve got to try and beat this wind, and the
only way we can do it is to get up all the speed
possible, and cut down through the air. Bob,
hand me that monkey-wrench. Ned, you tighten
up the intake valves, and open the outlets on the
port cylinders. I’ll set the electric generator to
give a hotter spark and one at shorter intervals.
We’ve <em>got</em> to go down!”</p>

<p>The need was increasing every moment, for the
hurricane, instead of dying out, was getting worse
every second.</p>

<p>Soon the motor was working at twice its former
speed. The great propellers could be observed
whirling around with terrific power. Now,
if ever, the <i>Comet</i> should go down. Anxiously
they watched the needle of the barograph. It
remained stationary for a few minutes, during
which the craft trembled from end to end with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the awful strain. Then the pointer swung slowly
around.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” cried Ned in delight.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re going down,” observed Jerry, with
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“And none too soon,” added Bob, as another
gust sent the motorship on end.</p>

<p>It was a struggle between the forces of nature
and those of man, and the machinery won.
Slowly the airship was forced down on a slant
until, finally piercing through the strata that represented
the terrific wind, she came to a calm region
about two thousand feet above the sea. Then,
bringing her to a level keel, Jerry sent the craft
onward.</p>

<p>“And not a sign of the <i>Manhattan</i>,” remarked
Ned, a little later, when the motor had been
slowed down to its usual speed.</p>

<p>“No,” spoke Jerry, “but the search isn’t over
yet. I’m sure we’re going in the right direction,
though. The hurricane did us that much service,
for it’s evident that the missing balloon was
caught just as we were, only they haven’t powerful
enough machinery to get out of it. Now we’ll
keep on at this level, and in this direction.”</p>

<p>Nothing developed the rest of that day. They
flew onward slowly, taking turns scanning the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
about them through a powerful telescope for a
sight of the dirigible containing the man whose
aid was so greatly needed by Mr. Slade. But the
<i>Manhattan</i> was not seen.</p>

<p>At night they set the powerful searchlight
aglow, hoping that it might be observed by those
whom they sought, and who possibly could send
out a signal, indicating their position. But no signal
came. Thus two more days passed, and the
<i>Comet</i> at times was sent about, back over the
air-line over which they had come, for Jerry
feared they might have passed the missing balloon
in the night.</p>

<p>Several times they dropped to the surface of
the ocean, to give Professor Snodgrass a chance
to use his net in an endeavor to get the singing
fish. But his efforts were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>“It seems as if there was a hoodoo on this trip,”
spoke Ned gloomily, one morning as they were
sailing along. “We missed Mr. Jackson at every
point, and now no one knows where he is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll find him yet,” said Jerry cheerfully.
“I tell you what let’s do: go down on the hydroplanes
and fish! Some fresh fish would go good
for dinner; eh, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Sure. I’ll fry ’em brown in corn-meal. Send
her down, Jerry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was once more dropped to the surface
of the sea, and the boys got out their lines.
They had pretty good luck, and a fish dinner was
a certainty. Of course, the professor only tried
for his prize, but he did not get it.</p>

<p>Bob was just landing a large fish, and was
giving all his energy to it, when the attention of
Ned and Jerry was attracted to a large steamer,
which was rapidly approaching them. They had
not noticed her creeping up on the horizon.</p>

<p>“She seems to be heading this way,” observed
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; maybe she wants to see what sort of a
craft we are, fellows,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a puff of smoke, a dull
flash, and a booming sound came over the water.</p>

<p>“They’re firing at us!” cried Bob, who had
landed his fish.</p>

<p>“No; I think it’s a signal,” remarked Jerry,
who had observed closely, and had not seen a
projectile bounding over the wave crests. “They
may take us for a wreck, and want us to know
that we’re going to be saved.”</p>

<p>This, as they learned later, was the reason for
the shot. On came the steamer, and soon it was
within hailing distance. The rails were lined
with curious passengers, many of whom were taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
snap-shots of the <i>Comet</i>, as she rested lightly
on the water. On the steamer’s bridge were the
captain and a number of officers.</p>

<p>“What sort of a craft are you, and what are
you doing?” came the hail through a megaphone.</p>

<p>“The <i>Comet</i>, of Cresville,” returned Jerry.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know. We’re looking for a disabled
balloon.”</p>

<p>“Do you need any help?”</p>

<p>It was evident that Jerry’s answers were not
well understood since before he could reply to
the question about aid, a small boat was lowered,
and came rapidly toward the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Do you want to be taken off?” asked the mate
in charge.</p>

<p>“No; we’re all right,” was Jerry’s reply.
“We’re going on through the air soon. We just
came down here to catch some fish. But have
you seen anything of the balloon <i>Manhattan</i>,
which ought to be somewhere out to sea?”</p>

<p>The mate had not, nor had the sailors, and it
was evident that they hardly knew what to believe
about the <i>Comet</i>. Seeing their incredulity, Jerry
started the air-propellers, and, getting a flying
start, mounted up into the sky, circling over and
around the steamer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>There were cries of wonder at this, and a round
of applause from the passengers and crew. Then
the boys dropped back to the ocean again on the
hydroplanes, and, in response to a request from
the captain, Jerry and Bob went aboard the <i>Cinnabar</i>,
leaving Ned and Mr. Snodgrass on the
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Jerry explained to an admiring and wondering
throng the object of their voyage through the air.</p>

<p>“But we can’t get a sight of the <i>Manhattan</i>,”
he concluded, “and we want to very much, for we
wish to rescue the people aboard her, and it is
very necessary for us to get Mr. Jackson’s signature
to certain papers.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the greatest stunt I ever heard
of,” declared the captain. “Using one airship to
go to the rescue of another. But can’t you pick
her up by wireless?”</p>

<p>“We’ve tried, but none of our signals are answered,”
replied Bob.</p>

<p>“Their apparatus may be disabled,” said Jerry.
“Well, if you haven’t sighted her, we’ll have to
keep on hunting.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” suggested the commander.
“I’ll have an inquiry made among the crew and
passengers. None of my officers have reported
seeing anything like a runaway balloon, but it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
just possible that some one else may have sighted
it, and said nothing about it.”</p>

<p>A steward was sent to make a general inquiry,
and, while waiting, Jerry explained the nature of
the <i>Comet</i>, and how she worked.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the captain, as the steward returned,
“did you learn anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the unexpected answer; “last
night, when Lars Porsen had the bow lookout, he
said he saw, about midnight, several lights, close
together in the sky, quite a distance up. They
were moving rapidly, and, all at once, they seemed
to come down toward the sea. He thought they
were shooting stars, until he heard voices crying.
Then he got frightened, being of a superstitious
nature, sir, and he decided not to report it. But
he thinks now, that it may have been the missing
airship being blown along, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s her, without a doubt!” cried Jerry excitedly.
“In what direction was she?”</p>

<p>“A little to the north-east of here,” replied the
steward, “and she was making rather a northerly
course, according to Porsen.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve been on the wrong track!” cried
the tall lad. “We’ll change our direction! Come
on, Bob! I believe we have a clew at last!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>THE WRECK</small></h2>


<p>Despite the invitation of the captain to remain
longer aboard the <i>Cinnabar</i>, Jerry and Bob insisted
on going back at once to the floating <i>Comet</i>.
Lars Porsen was sent for and questioned, but he
could add little to what he had told the steward.
There seemed no doubt but that he had sighted
the missing <i>Manhattan</i>.</p>

<p>“This will be good news for Ned,” remarked
Jerry, as he and his chum were being rowed back
to their air-craft, and indeed the merchant’s son
was delighted with it. He had begun to give up
hope, and when he thought of his father waiting
for the aid of Mr. Jackson, fighting off his relentless
business enemies, the heart of Ned was sad.
Now he brightened up.</p>

<p>“We’ll get right on the trail!” he cried. “Come
on, Jerry, speed the <i>Comet</i> up as fast as she’ll
go.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for if any one is left alive on the balloon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
they must need help by this time,” observed the
tall lad. “They may have given up hope of ever
being rescued.”</p>

<p>“I hope they have plenty to eat,” remarked
Bob, with a tragic air, as he thought of the well-filled
larders of the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Oh, you cannibal!” cried Ned, as he hastened
here and there, helping Jerry get ready to send the
motorship on her way again.</p>

<p>The passengers and crew of the <i>Cinnabar</i>
cheered as the gallant little craft left the waves
and flew into the air. Then, circling about, and
dipping the airship down in place of lowering any
colors, in response to three hoarse blasts from the
steamer’s whistle, Jerry sent the <i>Comet</i> off in the
direction indicated by the sailor.</p>

<p>Soon the smoke of the big vessel was left far
astern, and once more our friends were peering
eagerly forward through the telescope for a sight
of the disabled balloon.</p>

<p>Bob prepared the fish they had caught in so
many different ways, and so often, that Ned and
Jerry declared they never wanted to see a hook
or line again. But they also had good meals of
other viands, for Bob gave his whole attention to
the task of cooking. Indeed, for the next few
days there was little else to do. They kept on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
moving slowly, so as not to miss the big balloon,
and travelling a few miles on either side of the
direct course, pursuing a sort of zig-zag way, in
order to cover more space.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had his note-books all
written up&mdash;he had classified and arranged all his
specimens, and then he sighed for new ones. But
none was to be had, for they were now well out to
sea, beyond the limits of birds or insects, and the
water below them offered the only dwelling-place
of specimens. As they did not want to lose time,
they did not go down again for some time.</p>

<p>One evening, after an uneventful day, when
their eyes ached with the strain of looking in vain
for the balloon, the three boys were sitting on the
forward deck, talking over matters connected with
their trip. The automatic steering apparatus had
been set, and there was no need of any one being
in the pilot house.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jerry, who had been listening to some
banter between Bob and Ned, jumped to his feet,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I smell smoke! There must be something
afire!”</p>

<p>“So do I!” added Ned.</p>

<p>It was enough to cause intense alarm to all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
them, for a fire on board the airship, with the
tanks filled with the lifting gas, was a terror most
to be dreaded.</p>

<p>Fairly running, Jerry made his way back to the
stern, followed by his two chums. The smell of
smoke became stronger as they neared the after-deck,
and, once they were beyond the deck superstructures,
they caught fleeting glimpses of darting
tongues of fire.</p>

<p>“Quick! Bring the extinguishers! They’re in
the main cabin!” cried Jerry. Bob and Ned
started back after them, while the tall lad kept
on, to discover the location of the fire, which
seemed to be in the very stern of the craft.</p>

<p>Jerry saw some dark object, from which the
smoke seemed to be coming, and in the interior of
which were seen the flames. He was about to
rush at it, and toss it overboard, thinking fire
might have been started by spontaneous combustion
in some box or crate, when Bob and Ned ran
up with chemical extinguishers.</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Jerry, pointing to the fire.
“Play the hose there!”</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a yell, and from the midst
of the dark object, which the boys could now see
was a canvas shelter, like a small tent, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
sprang Professor Snodgrass, all dripping from
the chemicals.</p>

<p>“Here! What’s the matter?” he shouted.
“Stop! You’re drowning me!”</p>

<p>“We’re trying to put out the fire!” yelled Jerry.
“What were you doing there? Are you burned?
Did the smoke make you unconscious?”</p>

<p>“Fire! There’s no fire!” cried the little scientist,
as he wiped the trickling chemicals from his
face.</p>

<p>“No fire! Why the smoke?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“And the flames!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“And the smell!” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“It was no fire,” went on the scientist, as he
kicked over the canvas shelter. “I had just made
a little smudge on a piece of sheet iron. I was
smoking one of the fish I had caught, to preserve
the specimen. I built a fire out here on deck,
where there would be no danger, and put certain
chemicals on it to preserve the fish skin. That’s
what made the smell.”</p>

<p>“It certainly <em>smelled</em>, all right,” grimly remarked
Jerry. “Are you sure there’s no fire on
the deck boards, professor?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Oh, I took good care there would
be no danger. I put a pan of water on deck, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
on top of that I laid some sheet-iron. Then I
made a little fire of wood and old rags on the iron,
sprinkled the chemicals in the flames, and held the
fish over them. I’m sorry if I caused you any
fright.”</p>

<p>“Well you did&mdash;a little,” admitted Jerry, “but
I guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I more than paid for it,” interrupted the scientist
with a smile. “However, it’s all done. I just
got through as you squirted the chemicals on me.”</p>

<p>As he had said, he had taken precautions
against the little blaze spreading, and now the
charred wood and rags on the sheet of iron were
dropped into the ocean.</p>

<p>“You never can tell what he’s going to do
next,” complained Jerry to his chums, with a
smile, as they went into the cabin.</p>

<p>All the next day they watched. Several times
they mistook low-lying clouds, or a dark bit of
mist for the balloon they sought, but, on increasing
their speed, and hastening toward it, they saw
their error.</p>

<p>It was toward the close of the afternoon when
Bob, who was on the lookout in the bow, cried:</p>

<p>“Hi, fellows, here’s something!”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned hastened forward. There,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
floating on the ocean, which was about a thousand
feet below them, was a dark mass, slowly rising
and falling on the swell.</p>

<p>“The balloon! Wrecked!” cried Ned. “We’re
too late!”</p>

<p>“It certainly is some sort of a wreck,” agreed
Jerry, as he adjusted the telescope. He took a
long look through the glass. Then he shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I can’t make it out on account of the haze,” he
said. “We’ll go down to it. Speed up the motor,
Ned.”</p>

<small>ATTACKED BY A WHALE</small></h2>


<p>Rapidly the motorship shot downward to the
surface of the sea, landing on her hydroplanes.
She was about half a mile from the dark object
that floated on the water, a confused mass of
twisted iron, splintered wood and flapping canvas.
Jerry had not dared drop any closer to it, lest a
sudden gust of wind might carry the <i>Comet</i>
against the sharp points and damage her.</p>

<p>“What do you make it out to be?” asked Ned,
as they neared the wreck, the <i>Comet</i> being sent
ahead by her water propeller.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the balloon, that’s sure,” declared
Jerry. “That is, unless it’s all twisted together.”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t believe it’s the <i>Manhattan</i>,”
agreed Bob.</p>

<p>Ned certainly hoped that it was not, for that
would mean the end of his efforts to find Mr. Jackson
alive. As they drew nearer to the floating
mass, they saw that it was the part of some sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
craft, which had come to grief through stress of
wind and wave.</p>

<p>“A derelict,” remarked Professor Snodgrass,
as the <i>Comet</i> came to a stop not far from it. “A
floating derelict, and a great menace to navigation.
If some steamer were to hit that in a fog, or on a
dark night, it might send her to the bottom. I
wish we could go aboard.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Because I might get some specimens on her.
Perhaps some of the crew, before they abandoned
her, might have had some strange birds, animals
or insects from the tropics, and if they were left
behind, as they probably were, they would prove
to be a valuable addition to my collection.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we can’t go on her unless we
swim,” said Jerry. “We have a small boat
aboard, but the sea is a little too rough to permit
its use to-day.”</p>

<p>“Circle around the wreck, and see if we can
discover her name,” suggested Ned. “Perhaps
there might be a dog or cat aboard, that we could
rescue.”</p>

<p>Slowly the <i>Comet</i> made a course around the
wreck, and far enough away so that the wash of
the sea would not ram her up against the abandoned
vessel’s sides. The boys could discover no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
name on the derelict. Either it had been worn
away by the action of the water, or that part of
the ship where it should have appeared was ripped
off. It seemed as if the wreck had been abandoned
some time ago.</p>

<p>There was no sign of life aboard her, though
Mr. Snodgrass was sure he could have at least
discovered some stray bugs had he been given a
chance to search, but it could not be done.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll get under way again, I guess,” observed
Jerry. “Perhaps to-morrow we’ll have
better luck.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t have <em>some</em> luck pretty soon, we’ll
have to go back, I suppose,” remarked Ned
gloomily.</p>

<p>“We have enough to eat for three weeks
more,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, trust you for that, Chunky; but how
about gasolene and oil?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have enough for another week, anyhow,
and perhaps longer,” declared Jerry.
“We’re not going to give up the search yet, Ned.
We’ll find Mr. Jackson, and save your father’s
business.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured the merchant’s son.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had improved the time by
getting out his net and dragging the sea for fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
specimens. He caught several varieties, but none
that he wanted. The singing flying-fish was not
among those in his net.</p>

<p>He was about to pull it in, when he saw a long,
dark shadow moving slowly along on the port side
of the <i>Comet</i>. The professor knew the shape at
once.</p>

<p>“Here, boys!” he called. “See this monster
shark!”</p>

<p>It was indeed a large specimen of the tiger of
the seas, and as it moved slowly along, its horrid
eyes seeking some prey, the boys could not repress
a shudder of fear.</p>

<p>“If he ever got after us!” exclaimed Bob.
“Ugh! Excuse me!”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>“There’s another coming up,” observed Jerry,
pointing to a shadow farther out. “That’s bigger
than the first one.”</p>

<p>Slowly another great form approached the
<i>Comet</i>. Then the boys saw that there were two
parts to the second shadow.</p>

<p>“It’s a whale and her calf!” exclaimed the professor.
“Boys, you are looking at a very rare
sight. Make the most of it!”</p>

<p>“It will be a good thing if they don’t make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
mince-meat of us,” remarked Ned grimly. “I’d
hate to fall overboard now.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, there was a sudden swirl in the
water, a smother of foam, and then a tinge of
red.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Bob. “The shark has attacked
the whale!”</p>

<p>“Not the whale, but the little calf!” yelled
Jerry. “Why, the shark has bitten it almost in
two pieces! We’d better get away from here, or
there’ll be a fight between those monsters and
some waves that will swamp us!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed the professor. “The
shark has killed the whale’s calf. Now there will
be trouble. There’s nothing worse than a whale
bereft of her young. Better go up, Jerry.”</p>

<p>The lad ran to the pilot house to start the air-propellers.
He had hardly reached the place,
however, before a cry from his companions caused
him to look back. The whale mother had fairly
leaped from the water, falling back with a tremendous
splash that raised a series of big waves
which rocked the <i>Comet</i> to and fro.</p>

<p>“Get up! Get up!” begged Bob and Ned, running
toward Jerry. “We’ll be swamped!”</p>

<p>Jerry grasped the starting lever, but, for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
reason, the motor failed to respond. He shoved
it back and forth and vibrated the spark adjuster.
But the air-propellers refused to turn.</p>

<p>“Start the water-screw, and get as far off as
we can,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“You do it, and I’ll work at this lever,” called
Jerry.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he glanced back, and his cry of
horror caused his companions to look where he
pointed. Some distance off, and coming forward
with increasing speed, was the whale, headed
right for the floating motorship.</p>

<p>“She’s going to attack us!” cried Ned. “She
thinks our craft killed her calf, and she’s going
to ram us! Look out!”</p>

<p>Maddened by the loss of her offspring, the
gigantic whale, as Ned had said, was about to
attack the <i>Comet</i>, which was almost at the mercy
of the leviathan, now that the air-propellers refused
to operate. It was a critical moment for
our heroes.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE SINGING FISH</small></h2>


<p>On came the whale. Every moment seemed to
increase the terrific speed of the maddened animal.
Frantically the boys labored to get out of
the way, but it was almost impossible until the
air-propellers should start, and send the <i>Comet</i>
skimming over the surface.</p>

<p>“Have you the water-screw going?” called
Jerry to Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s speeded up as high as it will go!
Can’t you get that motor started?”</p>

<p>“Can’t seem to.”</p>

<p>“Hurry! Hurry!” yelled Bob. “She’ll ram us
in another second or two!”</p>

<p>“We’ll be destroyed if she does!” muttered
Professor Snodgrass. “Oh, my precious collection!
My valuable specimens! What shall I
do?”</p>

<p>He rushed here and there, trying to gather all
his boxes in one pile, and then to take them under
his arms, but they continually fell out.</p>

<p>“It’s no use!” cried Jerry, at length. “I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
get this motor started. Get ready to jump, when
the whale hits us! Grab life-preservers&mdash;make
for the wreck and cling to that, for there’ll be
nothing left of the <i>Comet</i>!”</p>

<p>He abandoned his attempt at the air-propeller
motor. The water-screw was sending the craft
ahead at fairly good speed, but nothing to the
progress made by the whale. She was almost
upon them.</p>

<p>The boys made ready to jump, preparing to
abandon their beloved craft, when a curious thing
happened. In front of the oncoming whale was a
big mound of green water, piled up by the enormous
blunt head of the leviathan, just as in front
of some blunt-nosed scow there is a wave. In
this case, such was the speed of the animal, that
the wave actually hid the big head from sight.</p>

<p>And it was this advancing wall of water which
saved the lives of our friends and prevented the
destruction of the motorship. For, so light and
buoyant was the craft, that as the swell of the
mound of water, which was in front of the whale,
reached the <i>Comet</i>, she was lifted up like a chip
on the crest of a billow.</p>

<p>Up and up she went, higher and higher on the
swell, until in the excess of her fury, the whale
brought about the very opposite to that which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
intended, for, instead of ramming the strange
craft, she passed completely under it, harmlessly.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the boys and the professor
could not realize their marvellous escape. Then
they understood, and uttered a cheer of congratulation.</p>

<p>“She’s passed under us!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“There she is, away over there!” shouted Bob,
pointing to where the whale’s progress could be
observed by the mound of water.</p>

<p>“She’ll be back as soon as she realizes her mistake,”
predicted Ned, and, even at that moment,
the big creature began to turn, ready to return to
the attack. But now, most unexpectedly, as Jerry
rushed back to the starting lever of the main motor,
the machine worked like a charm. There
was a hum and a buzz, the propellers whirred
around, and, skimming lightly over the surface of
the ocean, the <i>Comet</i> suddenly arose, and shot
into the air. And not a moment too soon, either,
for, as her hydroplanes left the surface, dripping
salty drops, the whale passed under again, one
plane scraping her scale-covered back.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">“Safe!” cried Jerry, and there was a breath of
relief from all on board.</a></p>

<p>“Look!” yelled Ned, pointing down. “The
whale and the shark are fighting!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The two monsters of the deep were in a battle
to the death, the whale seeking to kill the gigantic
shark by a blow from her tail, and the sea-tiger
trying to bite the leviathan as it had the baby
whale. How the battle terminated, the boys
could not determine, as their swiftly-moving craft
took them beyond the scene. Once more they
were sailing the air.</p>

<p>“And I didn’t get my singing-fish, after all,”
sighed Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“We were lucky to get off with our lives,” remarked
Jerry. “But you’ll have another chance
for your prize, professor.”</p>

<p>It soon got dark, and once more, with her
searchlight aglow, the <i>Comet</i> sped on through the
night. As before, the boys took turns looking for
any strange lights which might indicate the balloon
of which they were in search. But morning
came with no sign of her.</p>

<p>It was a calm day, and, after travelling for
some miles in the new direction, and seeing nothing,
Jerry yielded to the requests of the scientist,
and again let the craft float on the hydroplanes.</p>

<p>“For we are now over the region where I expect
to find the singing-fish,” said the professor,
“and it would be a pity not to try to get it.”</p>

<p>The boys thought so, too, and though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
were anxious to keep on with their quest, they
could not refuse to give the professor a little
time. He used his net for several hours, bringing
up many strange creatures of the sea. Some of
these he kept for himself, or for brother scientists,
but the odd fish was not among them.</p>

<p>Jerry was about to tell Mr. Snodgrass that
they could not spare more time, when the scientist,
who had his net overboard, suddenly called:</p>

<p>“Oh, boys, I’ve got something big! Help me
pull it in!” He was laboring at the rope, and
evidently something was in the net, for there was
a turmoil in the water, and the professor nearly
went overboard.</p>

<p>“Quick! Help him!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>Bob and Ned sprang to the aid of the little
man, and, by a strong pull, had the net on deck.
It contained but one fish, a large one, that flopped
violently about the deck, as if in protest at the
treatment it had received.</p>

<p>But, at the sight of it, and of two fins that
looked something like wings, the professor uttered
a joyful shout.</p>

<p>“It’s the singing-fish! The singing flying-fish!”
he cried. “At last I have caught it!
Listen!”</p>

<p>Hardly had he ceased speaking, than the queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
fish opened its mouth, and there came forth something
between a whine and a low groan. It was
anything but singing, but to the professor, this
was evidently to be preferred to the sweetest
music.</p>

<p>“Hear it sing! Hear it sing!” he cried. “You
boys will be witness to it, for I’m afraid I can’t
keep so large a fish alive until we get home. But
it sang; didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; if you call that singing,” remarked Bob
in a low voice. “I’ve heard catfish do the same
thing.” In fact, the noise made by the odd fish
was not unlike the sound a catfish, or bullhead,
makes when caught. But the professor was satisfied.</p>

<p>“Help me get him into a tank of water, until
I make some notes about him while he is still
alive,” the scientist begged, and the boys aided
him. He was engaged in making copious notes
about his prize, and Jerry was sending the <i>Comet</i>
up into the air, when Bob, who was in the bow,
looking upward, pointed at some object, and cried
out:</p>

<p>“The balloon! The <i>Manhattan</i>! There she
is, boys! There is what we’ve been looking for
so long!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>THE UNCONSCIOUS CREW</small></h2>


<p>Hardly able to believe or realize what Bob
shouted, Jerry and Ned looked to where he
pointed. There, in the air over their heads, perhaps
a mile or two miles high, was a cigar-shaped,
black object, floating along in a gentle wind. It
looked like some big bird, winging its way over
the ocean, but well the boys knew no birds would
be so far from land.</p>

<p>“It’s the balloon! The dirigible!” cried Bob
again.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Chunky!” yelled Ned, “I believe
you’re right! Speed up, Jerry! Can it be possible
that we have really found her, and at last we
will be able to see Mr. Jackson?”</p>

<p>“It’s the balloon, all right,” agreed Jerry
slowly. “But whether it’s the one we want or not,
is another question.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon settle that. I’ll get the telescope,”
cried Ned.</p>

<p>He rushed into the main cabin, and came back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
with the powerful glass. This he focused on the
black object, which seemed to increase in size as
the <i>Comet</i>, shooting upward, came nearer and
nearer to it.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Jerry anxiously.</p>

<p>“I can’t make out any name on it,” replied Ned,
“but it’s a dirigible balloon, all right, and it’s
hardly likely to be any other than the disabled
<i>Manhattan</i>.”</p>

<p>“Can you see any one on board?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No; I can’t make out a soul. But they may
be all inside the cabin.”</p>

<p>“Or dead,” thought Jerry grimly, but he did
not say so. He would hope for the best.</p>

<p>“Let’s get there as fast as we can!” proposed
Ned eagerly. “They may need help very much.”</p>

<p>“And they may be hungry!” added Bob. “I’ll
go get things ready for a meal.” And this time
his chums did not laugh at him. The occasion was
too serious.</p>

<p>“We’d better be getting out the ropes and
planks ready for a rescue,” suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>“Are you really going to take off those people,
if there are any in that balloon?” asked the professor,
laying aside his note-books.</p>

<p>“That’s the only thing to do,” said Jerry. “We
can’t tow their disabled craft back, and the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
thing to do is to rescue them in mid-air. Ned,
suppose you and Mr. Snodgrass get out the planks
and ropes, while Bob attends to the food, and
I’ll get the <i>Comet</i> to the balloon as fast as the
propellers will take her.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” cried Ned eagerly. “Oh, to think that
at last I’ve really got Mr. Jackson where he can’t
get away from me! I wish I could send dad a
wireless message, telling him of our success!”</p>

<p>“Better wait until you get the signature,” suggested
Jerry, for, somehow, he did not like the
fact that there came no signal from the floating
balloon. If the crew on board was alive, he argued,
they would naturally give some indication
when they saw a craft coming to their rescue. But
there was not the slightest sign of life aboard
the <i>Manhattan</i>.</p>

<p>More and more swiftly through the air rushed
the <i>Comet</i>. She was now so close that many details
of the balloon could be made out, and the
boys at once recognized it as the one they had
seen leave the aviation grounds as they approached.
It was the missing <i>Manhattan</i> beyond
a doubt.</p>

<p>Ned and the professor were busy laying out the
planks; Bob could be heard rattling about in the
galley, and Jerry was doing his utmost to get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
top limit of speed from the motor. The <i>Comet</i>
was now on a level with the balloon, and was
rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>Setting the automatic steering apparatus, Jerry
took up a telescope, and once more gazed through
it at the balloon. As the craft came into focus,
the youth uttered a strange cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Ned, running
toward his chum.</p>

<p>“Look,” answered Jerry hoarsely, passing over
the glass.</p>

<p>“They’re all dead!” gasped the merchant’s son,
as he focused the telescope. “All dead!”</p>

<p>For the sight that came to him through the
glass was that of a number of men lying in various
positions in the after or open cabin of the
<i>Manhattan</i>. Men were stretched out on the floor,
some were humped over in chairs, and one could
be seen half in and half out of an open door that
led into the cabin.</p>

<p>“They’re all dead!” cried Ned again. “We’re
too late!”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re only unconscious,” suggested
Jerry hopefully, though his heart misgave him.
“We’ll go closer and see.”</p>

<p>Bob came from the galley to join his chums.
As he reached them he sniffed the air suspiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that funny smell?” he asked. “It’s
like gas. Have you started our gas-machine,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Our gas-machine? No, but&mdash;I have it!” he
cried suddenly.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Ned, catching a gleam
of hope in Jerry’s tone.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> gas! It’s gas escaping from the disabled
balloon! That’s what has made the crew of the
<i>Manhattan</i> unconscious. Perhaps they’re not
dead at all, but overcome by gas. We must keep
on to the rescue!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>THE RESCUE&mdash;CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>The smell of escaping gas from the bag of the
big balloon became more pronounced as the
<i>Comet</i> approached. Eagerly the boys and Professor
Snodgrass looked toward the disabled craft
which was slowly drifting ahead of them, but
which they were rapidly overhauling.</p>

<p>“We hadn’t better go too close; had we?” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Jerry. “We’ve got to get
pretty close or we can’t rescue them. The planks
are about fifteen feet long, and we’ll have to come
within that distance, anyhow, to make a bridge
from the <i>Manhattan</i> to our deck.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of the gas,” went on the stout
lad, who seemed to have some difficulty in breathing.
“It might&mdash;we might be overcome,” and he
coughed raspingly.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Jerry, with a start. “I
hadn’t thought of that. Whew! But that vapor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<em>is</em> strong. It’s different from what we use. I
wonder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A fit of coughing interrupted him, and soon
Ned and the professor were wheezing and sneezing,
as the powerful fumes were wafted to them.</p>

<p>“We can’t stand this!” gasped the tall lad.
“No wonder these men are unconscious. It’s a
slim chance if they’re alive, after breathing those
fumes!”</p>

<p>A look of despair came over Ned’s face. Was
he, after all, to lose the last opportunity to aid
his father? Was Mr. Jackson dead?</p>

<p>“We can’t go any closer!” declared Jerry at
length. “It will mean death or unconsciousness,
if we do. I’ve got to halt the airship!”</p>

<p>Coughing and spluttering, he made his way to
the pilot house, and brought the motor to a stop.
Then, as the <i>Comet</i> could no longer sustain herself
on her wings, being bereft of motion, she began
to sink, until Jerry started the gas-machine,
making a dirigible balloon of the craft. With the
big bag inflated, she floated lazily in the air, about
a quarter of a mile from the <i>Manhattan</i>. Both
were being driven slowly onward by a light wind.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done?” demanded Bob.
Breathing was easier for them all now, as they
were not so near the disabled balloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the problem,” declared Jerry. “We
can’t go any closer without being in danger ourselves,
and we can’t rescue those men until we get
within ten or fifteen feet of them.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we wait until all the gas escaped
from their bag, and then venture up?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“By that time those men will be dead, if they
are not lifeless already,” answered Jerry solemnly.</p>

<p>It was a trying situation. To be within sight
of the men they wanted to save, to be near Mr.
Jackson, on whom so much depended, and yet not
able to reach him and his companions, was tantalizing.
Yet they all recognized the truth of what
Jerry said. It would be death for them all to
venture nearer.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass, who had been curiously
sniffing the air, as though to determine the nature
of the gas, suddenly gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Boys, I think I have it!” he cried eagerly. “I
am not sure, but I think I know the composition
of the gas used in the bag of that balloon. If I
am right, I can easily manufacture, from the
chemicals I have, something that will neutralize
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you do it?” cried Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“I will, at once! Though I am not sure it will
work. If it does, all that will be necessary to do
will be to saturate a handkerchief with the solution
I will make, tie the cloth over our mouth and
nose, and then all the gas breathed through it will
be harmless.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we need!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>The professor lost no time in getting to work.
He mixed up various chemicals in a flask, heated
them, and then wet a handkerchief in the liquid.
Binding the cloth over his nose and mouth, he
went out to breathe the air, which was still slightly
laden with the poisonous fumes. The professor
inhaled deeply.</p>

<p>“Does it work?” asked Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“I think it does,” was the reply. “We will
have to go nearer to make sure.”</p>

<p>It did not take long for all to adjust the wet
handkerchiefs over their mouths and noses. Jerry
then started the propellers, and once more the
<i>Comet</i> approached the <i>Manhattan</i>. Could they
come close enough to make the rescue, and still
be safe themselves? Each breath they drew would
soon tell the story.</p>

<p>Anxiously they noted the effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t smell or breathe any gas!” mumbled
Ned, for the handkerchief interfered with speaking.</p>

<p>“Me, neither,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” declared the professor. “We
can go as close as we wish, but we can’t stay long,
for the chemical will soon evaporate. Work
lively, boys!”</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes more before the
<i>Comet</i> was close beside the disabled balloon. The
latter was a large craft, and was floating easily
along, her machinery silent. Silent, too, and motionless,
were the five men who constituted the
pilot and crew. In various attitudes they were
stretched in the open cabin, as if they had struggled
there for air. It could not yet be told
whether they were dead or alive.</p>

<p>“Quick, now!” mumbled Jerry. “Run out the
planks, and we’ll cross over and carry the men
on board here.”</p>

<p>He skillfully put the <i>Comet</i> alongside of the
other craft. There they were, high in the air
over the ocean, yet almost like two vehicles on
earth, or two boats floating on the surface of the
water. Jerry shut off the propellers, letting the
<i>Comet</i> drift at the same rate as did the other
craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>With a rope, Jerry next made the two balloons
fast to each other, to prevent them from drifting
apart. Then two planks were laid across from
the after-deck of the <i>Comet</i> to that of the <i>Manhattan</i>.
Quickly crossing on these, our heroes and
the professor boarded the disabled airship.</p>

<p>“There’s Mr. Jackson!” cried Mr. Snodgrass,
indicating one of the unconscious men.</p>

<p>“We must rescue him first!” declared Ned, and
no one disputed him. With the help of Jerry, the
merchant’s son <a href="#image04">carried the unconscious millionaire
across the narrow planks</a>, from one airship to the
other, high above the ocean which rolled beneath
them. It was a most marvellous rescue in mid-air!</p>

</div>

<p>“Now the rest!” called the professor. He and
Bob took up another man, and carried him to
safety. When Jerry and Ned returned for a third
member of the crew, the tall lad, looking into the
main, or closed cabin, noticed some sparks coming
from one of the electrical machines connected with
the wireless apparatus. It was run by a storage
battery, and must have been left connected and
turned on when the men were stricken down. A
stream of vivid, violet-colored sparks were emanating
from the contact points.</p>

<p>“By Jove, we must get away from here in a
hurry!” cried the tall lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?” asked Ned, pausing in the act of lifting
the feet of an unconscious man.</p>

<p>“Those sparks!” gasped Jerry. “They may
explode the gas any minute, and we’ll be blown
to atoms! Lively, Ned!”</p>

<p>Ned needed no urging. Rapidly he and Jerry
once more crossed the plank in mid-air with the
unfortunate man. On their next trip Jerry noticed
that a blue light was playing about the machine
whence the sparks came.</p>

<p>“She’ll go up in about a minute more!” he
gasped.</p>

<p>But two more men remained to be saved.
These were quickly carried across the bridge in
the air, and laid in the cabin of the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Cast off!” yelled Jerry, beginning to cough
again, for the deadly fumes were manifesting
themselves through the chemically saturated handkerchiefs.
“Cast off!”</p>

<p>It took but an instant to do it. The great propellers
were set in motion, and the <i>Comet</i> rapidly
glided away from the <i>Manhattan</i>. The boys
looked back at her, as she floated in mid-air.</p>

<p>“We must see to those men!” directed Jerry,
taking off the improvised mask, which was no
longer needed. “Perhaps it is even now too late!
Professor, will you help us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course. I think I know how to revive them,
if there is a spark of life left.”</p>

<p>“Look!” yelled Bob, pointing to the <i>Manhattan</i>.
A haze of flame surrounded the unfortunate
craft.</p>

<p>“It’s all up with her!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>The next instant there came a terrific explosion,
and the dirigible was scattered to the four winds,
to fall in a shower of canvas, silk and broken machinery
into the sea, there to disappear from sight
forever.</p>

<p>“We got away just in time,” spoke Ned in awed
tones.</p>

<p>With the motor speeding her back across the
ocean, over which she had so gallantly come a
long distance, and with the automatic steering
apparatus set to guide her, no attention need be
paid to the <i>Comet</i> for some time. So the boys
and the professor devoted their energies to reviving
the men. That they were not dead was
soon established, though they were very nearly so.</p>

<p>But Professor Snodgrass knew just what to do,
and in about an hour, when some of the medicines
they had brought had been administered, Mr.
Jackson opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Where are we? What happened? Is there
any hope? Can you see any vessel that will save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
us?” he gasped. Evidently he thought himself
still aboard his own craft.</p>

<p>“You are all right, Wescott!” said Mr. Snodgrass.
“Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>“Uriah Snodgrass!” gasped the millionaire.
“Well, of all things! How did you get aboard
the <i>Manhattan</i>?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t. It’s you who are aboard here.
You’ve been rescued! The <i>Manhattan</i> is no
more!” And the scientist quickly explained what
had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson rapidly recovered from the fumes
of the gas, as did the members of the crew, and
his friend, Mr. Watson, who had made the trip
with him. Then the story of the rescue was told.</p>

<p>In turn Mr. Jackson related how, after ascending
to a great height soon after leaving the aviation
grounds, his craft was caught in the hurricane
and driven out to sea. Then the propelling machinery
broke, and they could only drift about at
the mercy of the wind. For days they were
driven onward, thinking each hour would be their
last. They tried to signal for help from steamers
passing below them, but could not, as their wireless
was soon out of order, and they were too high
up to make any other means effective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>They dared not descend, for fear of being
drowned. Besides, to go down, they would have
had to let the gas escape, and they had no means
of making more. To keep afloat was their only
hope, and they did, trusting to be rescued some
time. Then they were blown out of the steamship
lane, and did not know what to do.</p>

<p>Finally, when they had given up hope, and
were going to descend, and try to make some sort
of a raft to float on, there came a leak in the
gas-bag, and, one by one, they became unconscious.
A little longer and they would have been
dead. But the <i>Comet</i> came along in time.</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly am glad to see you again,
professor; and also your young friends,” said Mr.
Jackson heartily, when he was feeling somewhat
stronger.</p>

<p>“And <em>I’m</em> glad to see you,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, my friend here has a request to make of
you,” went on Mr. Snodgrass, “and, if possible,
I wish you would grant it. He has had quite a
chase after you.”</p>

<p>“I’d do most anything for you, Uriah,” declared
the millionaire, with a smile, “for I haven’t
forgotten the service you did me.”</p>

<p>“Then save Ned’s father from financial ruin,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was the request, and Ned at once brought out his
papers, and made a plea for the rescue of his parent’s
business. It did not take Mr. Jackson a
moment to make up his mind.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll help Mr. Slade,” he said; “not
only for his own sake, but because of his plucky
son and his chums, and also to beat that gang of
men who want to ruin him. Here, I’ll sign at
once, and you can be a witness, Uriah.” There
was the scratching of a pen, and Ned knew that
his father’s troubles were practically over.</p>

<p>Rapidly the <i>Comet</i> sped on her way, being
headed toward New York. Every hour the rescued
ones recovered their strength, and soon all
traces of the poisonous gas had vanished. Ned
was eager to telegraph the good news to his
father, and Jerry was soon able to get into wireless
communication with a steamer below them.
The operator, though much surprised to get a
message out of the air, readily promised to relay
it to New York and Cresville, as his apparatus
had a wider range than that of the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, I never expected to come so far over
the ocean,” remarked Jerry the next day, when
they were nearing the coast. “Our hydroplanes
did us good service.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re great,” commented Mr. Jackson.
“I’m going to put them on the next air-craft I
make.”</p>

<p>“Only for them I’d never have my singing-fish,”
said Mr. Snodgrass, who had made copious notes
about his prize. It had died, but he had preserved
it. “It is the most wonderful specimen I ever
caught,” he declared.</p>

<p>However, he soon afterward secured one that
was even stranger, when, in company with our
heroes, he went on another voyage with them.
The details of this will be found in the next volume
of this Series, to be called “The Motor Boys
on the Wing; or, Seeking the Airship Treasure.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how it will seem to be on solid
ground again?” asked Mr. Watson of Mr. Jackson,
when Jerry announced the next day that they
were within sight of New York.</p>

<p>“So good that I’m not going to leave it again in
a hurry,” announced the millionaire. “I’m done
with ballooning for the present, though I’m not
going to give it up altogether.”</p>

<p>They flew over New York, to the great astonishment
of the millions of that great city, and on
to the aviation ground, where a descent was made.
There our heroes were royally received, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
story of the marvellous rescue told over and over
again. The matter of the claim of Mr. Muggins
was adjusted, his lawyer advising him to accept
one hundred dollars, which he reluctantly did,
and the incident was closed.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s hurry home,” urged Ned, who
was anxious to give his father the valuable paper.
Mr. Jackson promised all the financial aid that
Mr. Slade needed, and said he would be glad to
see the merchant get the better of his financial
enemies.</p>

<p>And Mr. Slade did so. Thanks to the efforts
of Ned and his chums, the business was saved by
Mr. Jackson’s timely help, which was secured only
after such an exciting chase.</p>

<p>Cresville warmly welcomed the boys, who arrived
in their motorship, and Andy Rush was so
excited that he could only splutter for nearly half
a day, no one being able to understand what he
said.</p>

<p>“It was great! Great! Great!” he finally managed
to say, over and over again.</p>

<p>“Would you undertake it another time, Jerry?”
asked Ned one evening, when they were discussing
the recent happenings.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I think I would. It was
dangerous, but we came out of it all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a good thing I stocked up with plenty of
provisions,” declared Bob, and his two chums
laughed. And now, we will leave the Motor Boys
for a while, and say good-by.</p>
